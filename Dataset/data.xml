            <title>Solar Tariffs Fall to Record Low of Rs 2.36/Unit</title>
            <link>http://myimpact.in/index.php?page=Clipj&#38;id=fe551f7cfd044a62fe9b42946ef83786&#38;id2=bb6290da45c2d1cab9fc7233b346ffb9</link>
            <description> Bengaluru: Solar tariffs fell to a record low of *2.36 per unit at a recent auction in which six foreign firms bagged most of the 2,000 MW of projects for which bids were called, people close to the development said. ReNew Power is the only Indian firm among the winners.&#10;The lowest tariff until now had been * *2.44 per unit, reached in a Solar Corporation of India (SECI) auction in May 2017, and again in July 2018.&#10;SECI is the nodal agency through which the ministry of new and renewable energy conducts wind and solar power auctions. It declined to confirm the winning tariffs in the latest auction.&#10;According to the people cited earlier, Spain's Solarpack won 300 MW at *2.36 per unit, while Italy's Enel Green Power won 300MW at *2.37 per unit. Germany's IB Vogt won300MW at the same tar iff. Canadian developer AMP Energy and New York-based Eden Renewables won 100MW and 300MW, respectively, at&#10;*2.37 per unit.&#10;Ayana Renewable Power, which is backed by CDC Group (UK's development finance institution), won 300 MW at *2.38 per unit.&#10;Renew Power, an Indian company largely backed by foreign investors, won 400 MW at *2.38 per unit.&#10;The latest SECI tender had received an overwhelming response last week, with bids for more than 5,000 MW. Developers are free to choose where they want to set up their project in the country.&#10;"Solar equipment costs have been falling very sharply in the last six months because of Covid-related demand depression around the world, said Vinay Rustagi, managing director of renewable energy consultancy firm Bridge to India.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> Following reports of domestic power consumers receiving inflated bills this month, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has directed power companies to display transparency in its billing and resolve complaints.&#10;Shock and dismay&#10;Many consumers in Maharashtra including Bollywood actors had taken to Twitter to express shock over unexpectedly high electricity bills. Taking stock of the rising number of consumer complaints related to exorbi-&#10;Nitin Raut&#10;tant electricity bills, MERC has directed power companies to show transparency in its billing procedures and redress the consumer complaints immediately, Mr. Thackeray said.&#10;State Power Minister Nitin Raut said consumers can opt to pay their bills in three in&#10;stalments and those paying the entire bill amount will be given a 2% discount. Mr. Raut also directed Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (Mahadiscom) to start a public awareness campaign.&#10;He said, Mahadiscom could not take meter readings on the spot due to the lockdown. As a result, bills for April and May were given based on the average bill in the previous months.&#10;Spike in consumption'&#10;Mr. Raut said the inflated bills could be because of an increase in power consumption during the summer and more people working from home. All family members&#10;are indoors for 24 hours. Naturally, it will lead to an increased use of electricity in homes, he said.&#10;Mr. Raut also admitted that several people have complained of exorbitant bills despite being away in their home towns. The government will take real time meter readings in such cases and if the complaint is found to be true, the extra amount paid will be deducted from future bills, he said.&#10;On Monday, the MERC directed power distribution companies to look into the complaints. BEST, Tata Power, Adani Electricity supply power in Mumbai, while Mahadiscom provides electricity to the rest of the State.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> NEWDELHI, JUNE30&#10;THE HEAVY engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) Tuesday flagged off the final assembly of a cryostat the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber to Cadarache in France. The company has already delivered the base section, lower cylinder and upper cylinder for the cryostat. The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#10;L&#38;T Heavy Engineering won the contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012. It was conducted in collaboration with seven countries including India and the project outlay is around $20 billion. L&#38;T's scope of work for the cryostat was&#10;L&#38;T non-executive chairman AM Naik said he was apprehensive of bidding for the cryostat contract File&#10;to the tune of Rs 1300 crore.&#10;Explaining the project's importance, Anil V Parab, executive vice-president &#38; head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering, said this is the first time a 500-megawatt reactor has been built which is the commercial demonstration of fusion power.&#10;L&#38;T non-executive chairman&#10;AM Naik on Tuesday was quoted by P77 as saying he was apprehensive of bidding for the Rs 1,338-crore ITER's cryostat contract for the world's largest experimental thermo-nuclear fusion reactor in Cadarache as it was considered as too risky a bet.&#10;L&#38;T's management bandwidth and teams executing such an enormous project and that too far from India... this we have never done nor had done before. Hence the project was perceived to be too risky, Naik said during the virtual flag-off ceremony of the final assembly at L&#38;T's Hazira manufacturing complex However, Naik called it moment of pride for India and Larsen &#38; Toubro.&#10;SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, said, This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site... and eventually lead to the demonstration of large scale feasibility of fusion power.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will use the Okhla landfill site's garbage to produce syn gasa hydrogen-based fuel which will be later used to generate electricity. An MoU to set up a pilot project with a capacity to treat 50 tonnes of garbage per day was signed between the civic body, Indian Oil and NTPC on Tuesday&#10;SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the project will help in addressing the problem of garbage disposal. The plant will process 50 tonnes per day of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) segregated from municipal solid waste to produce syn gas which will be used to generate about 1 MW electricity,'Bharti added.&#10;The municipal corporation will provide 1 acre of land at the Okhla site on lease to Indian Oil for setting up the processing plant. SDMC will also purchase Ihepowergenera-&#10;ted from the plant. We will be able to save Rs 2.6 crores due to the purchase of power from the plant, he added.&#10;Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dhar mender Pradhan, LG Anil Baijal and SDMC functionaries participated in the MoU signing event through a video link.&#10;Indian Oil and NTPC will make an investment of 50 % each towards the capital cost involved in setting up the plant through a consortium. Indian Oil will facilitate&#10;the technology and handle the whole operation of the proposed plant, while NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation, said a civic official.&#10;This plant is an indigenous solution to solid waste problem and will help SDMC in achieving 100% waste processing. We will try to replicate the plan in other areas in future, said Anamika, south Delhi mayor.&#10;Union minister Pradhan&#10;added that Delhi generates 10,000 tonnes of waste every day and it is a challenge to manage and process the entire quantity. Suchplants will go a long way in production of enriched organic manure, generation of electricity and treatment of effluent water, headded.&#10;LG Anil Baijal said that such innovative undertakings will definitely reduce accumulation of municipal solid waste at landfill sites and will pave way for remediation of legacy waste.&#10;Power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said the proposed plant is an example of two ministries coming together for a good public cause just the way the prime minister talks about breaking silos.&#10;Synthesised gas is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide whichactsasa clean fuel. This project is based on clean technology and no pollution will be caused, added the civic official.&#10;&#10;</description>

In this project, 50 tonnes of waste per day (TPD) Refused Derived Fuel' (RDF) waste will be processed daily to convert waste into electricity. Such innovative undertaking will definitely reduce accumulation of municipal solid waste at landfill sites and will pave the way for remediation of legacy waste. The plant will process 50 tonnes per day of RDF feedstock and is expected to be set up within 14 months, a senior SDMC official said, adding that it will produce about one MW of electricity which will be sold to SDMC. In order to ensure an effective coordination between the parties, a joint coordination team will be formed immediately upon execution of this MoU. The JCT shall be responsible for coordination and monitoring the progress of activities as agreed in this MoU and for facilitating support between the parties, he said.&#10;Joined signing of MoU through VC between @OfficialSdmc, @IndianOilcl &#38; @ntpclimited for Development of Waste-toEnergy facilities at Okhla Landfill Site with Hon'ble Union Minister @dpradhanbjp, Hon'ble&#9;MoS&#10;@OfficeOfRKSingh &#38; other dignitaries, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal tweeted.&#10;In this project, 50 TPD RDF waste will be processed&#10;daily to convert waste into electricity. Such innovative undertaking will definitely reduce accumulation of Municipal Solid Waste at landfill sites &#38; will pave the way for remediation of legacy Waste, he said in another tweet.&#10;I am confident this project will go a long way in cleaning the city &#38; will be replicable and scalable too. An excellent initiative, my best wishes! he tweeted.&#10;Talking about role of the parties, the official said that Indian Oil will facilitate technology options to develop the plant as well as identify technology partner for engineering procurement construction (EPC).&#10;However, NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation of plants, as may be required, he said.&#10;The south Corporation will provide land of around one acre in Okhla landfill site for setting up of the facilities. The civic body will also provide RDF of requisite quantity as per design capacity besides facilitating all statutory approvals for setting up of the plant and other utilities such as water/electricity/approach roads, he said.&#10;SDMC Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti informed that this innovative project will address the problem of disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Under this project, the plant will process 50 tons per day of RDF segregated from MSW to produce one MW of electricity. SDMC will purchase the power generated from the plant at a mutually agreed rate. He further informed us that we will be able&#10;to save an amount of Rs.2.6 crores due to the purchase of power from the proposed plant, he said.&#10;The Commissioner further informed that investment of 50 per cent each by the Indian Oil and NTPC towards the capital cost in setting up of the plant through a consortium.

            <description> NEW DELHI&#10;Indias solar power tariff hit a record low of Rs2.36 per unit during a bid conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI).&#10;The lowest bid was placed by Spains Solarpack Corporation Tecnologica, S.A, said government officials. The second lowest bid of U2.37 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) was placed by Italys Enel Groupowned Avikaran Surya India Pvt. Ltd, along with Canadian AMP Solar Groups India unit, AMP Energy Green Pvt. Ltd, Frances EDEN Renewables, and lb Vogt Singapore Pte. Ltd.&#10;The UKs CDC Group-&#10;backed Ayana Renewable Power and Goldman Sachsbacked ReNew Power placed the third lowest bid off 2.37.&#10;While in May 2017, India had recorded the previous lowest bid for a solar power project at f2.44 per unit, this time the bids for the 2,000 mega watt project were called after New Delhi moved to impose basic customs duty on imported solar cells, modules, and inverters, from 1 August.&#10;Heartening to note that majority of the winners are foreign companies, in the true spirit of invest-in-India call by Honble @PMOIndia. This showcases India as an attractive investment destination, minister of state, new and renewable energy, Raj Kumar Singh said in a tweet.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> New Delhi.30.lune&#10;In a recent tender for setting up 2,000 Mw of solar power projects, a Spanish renewable firm quoted the lowest tariff in India's solar energy history. Solarpack Corporation bid Z2.36 per unit for 300 Mw of solar power project and, with this, has marked its entry into India. The tender, floated by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), is an all-India one, and the developer can set up the project anywhere. SECI is the nodal agency under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for renewable energy projects.&#10;Against the requested 2,000 Mw under the tender, SECI received bids for 5,280 Mw. Among other bidders were Avikiran Surya, which is backed by Italian utility Enel, and New York-based Eden Renewables, both of whom have won 300 Mw each for t2.37/unit.&#10;Ayana Renewable Power  backed by British CDC  and ReNew Power, have won 300 Mw and 400 Mw, respectively, for ^2.38/unit.&#10;The previous lowest bid&#10;was ?2.44/unit by ACME Solar in 2018 for a 600 mw project to be set in Rajasthan. The project is currently under litigation as ACME wants to withdraw from the same.&#10;This is the first such tender with the majority capacity bid and won by foreign players.&#10;India has set a target of 175 Gw of renewable power by 2022. Solar power will contribute 100 Gw to this target. Under the Paris Climate Change summit, India has committed 40 per cent of its energy demand to be sourced from clean energy.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <title>Govt plans pass-through in tariffs for already bid-out solar projects</title>
            <link>http://myimpact.in/index.php?page=Clipj&#38;id=01f0e0910080c0419d04b79a71cbc7f2&#38;id2=bb6290da45c2d1cab9fc7233b346ffb9</link>
            <description>  NEW DELHI&#10;The government plans to allow a pass-through in power tariffs for proj ects awarded before the basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar cells, modules, and inverters is imposed from 1 August, to protect solar project developers, said two people aware of the development.&#10;The move could lead to an increase in electricity tariffs but is being done to help developers set up these projects and maintain Indias clean energy trajectory as the government tightens its economic squeeze on China. An Indian is willing to pay more for power, pro&#10;vided the equipment is made in India, power and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh had said earlier.&#10;With tensions mounting along the India-China border, India is working on a wider decoupling exercise that involves imposing tariff and non-tariff barriers to check Chinese imports. This involves coming up with a list of approved manufacturers for government-supported schemes in the clean energy sector, including projects from where electricity distribution companies procure electricity for supply to their consumers.&#10;A similar approved list of modules and manufacturers is being made for the conventional power sector as well.&#10;All bids placed before the application of ALMM wont have to comply with it, said a government official, one of the two persons mentioned above, requesting anonymity.&#10;The other measure includes prior-permission requirements for power equipment imports from countries India has a conflict with, Mint had reported earlier. The government also&#10;aims to provide viability gap funding (VGF) to domestic manufacturers to promote its Make in India initiative.&#10;The imposition of BCD on imported solar cells, modules and inverters is to be followed by a plan to impose import duty on wafers and ingots that go into the manufacturing of solar cells and modules. The BCD follows the 29 July expiry of safeguard duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and Malaysia.&#10;Even as India is imposing a basic customs duty on imported solar cells, modules and inverters, any increase in costs due to a change in law after a bid has been placed will be a pass-through. There is a formula for pass-through in the&#10;biddingguidelines and all previous bids will be grandfathered, said the other government official mentioned above requesting anonymity.&#10;New Delhi also plans to discourage states from using Chinese equipment and technology in the strategic power sector by w ithholding funding to such projects from government-owned lenders, Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC), Rural Electrification Corp. Ltd (REQ, and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), if they use Chinese imports, Mint reported on 28 June.&#10;This will be done after the ALMM is put in place, said the first government official mentioned above.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> Privatization of electricity distribution in Ladakh and Ja mmu and Kashmir may have to wait due to security and strategic concerns and challenges of terrain. &#62;P18&#10;&#10;&#10;Setback for UT discom plan&#10; &#10;Security fears may hamper Ladakh, J&#38;K power discom privatization&#10;PFC has appointed SBI Capital Markets Ltd to help with the discom privatization in J&#38;K and Ladakh. priyankaparashar/mint&#10;Utpal Bhaskar&#10;utpal.b@livemint.com&#10;NEWDELHI&#10;Privatization of electricity distribution in Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir (J&#38;K) may have to wait due to security and strategic concerns and challenges of terrain and low power demand, three people aware of the development said.&#10;This comes against the backdrop of mounting tensions along the India-China border, particularly in the Galwan region of Ladakh, and increasing hostilities with Pakistan. Given the security imperatives, some believe that there is a need for critical power infrastructure in strategic areas to be controlled and managed by the government.&#10;Low power demand in Ladakh and some circles of Jammu and Kashmir, and extra time to unbundle power&#10;companies may add to the delay, said the people cited above, who are involved in the Union territories discom privatization process.&#10;Ladakh faces geographical challenges. It has a load of only around 30 MW (megawatts) because of low population density. It will also require large investments. New solu&#10;tions will have to be devised. There are also security concerns there. It has been put on hold. There has been no formal communication on the same, said the first of the three people cited above, all of whom spoke requesting anonymity.&#10;State-run Power Finance Corporation (PFC) has&#10;appointed SBI Capital Markets Ltd to help with the discom privatization in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, along with those in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu. Deloitte has received the mandate for Puducherry, Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.&#10;With the electricity load for Lakshadweep Islands being low, it is currently not being considered for privatization.&#10;Jammu and Kashmir was never being thought of as whole for discom privatization. It would first have been the populous and securitywise safer areas such as Jammu [that would havebeen] carved out and considered for privatization. The task is not easy, and is still under discussion, the second of the three persons said.&#10;Mint reported on 15 May about Indias plan to privatize all electricity discoms in the&#10;Union territories. These discoms have an enterprise value of around $700 million.&#10;Queries emailed to the spokespersons for power ministry, PFC and SBI Capital Markets Ltd remained unanswered.&#10;With around 1.82 million consumers and a percapita electricity consumption of 1,131 kilowatthour (kWh), J&#38;K has a peak power demand of 2.869MW. In comparis on,&#10;Delhis peak power demand touched7.409MW last year.&#10;After J&#38;K was reorganized as two Union territories, the Jammu &#38; Kashmir Power Development Department (JKPDD), which was responsible for electricity transmission and distribution, was unbundled into JK Power Corpora&#10;tion Ltd., Jammu Power Distribution Co. Ltd., Kashmir Power Distribution Co. Ltd., and JK Power Transmission Co. Ltd. While these utilities havebeen incorporated, some are yet to be operationalized.&#10;Also, in Ladakh, the plan is to club generation and distribution with the transmission function to be retained by Ladakh Power Distribution Department.&#10;There are issues around electricity supply and number of hours of supply in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Also, with the SERC (state electricity regulatory commission) dissolved, there have been no tariff hikes. There are also issues around security, said the third person cited above.&#10;Low electricity demand in Ladakh and some circles of J&#38;K has also added to the delay in discom privatization&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> Bengaluru: Solar tariffs fell to a record low of 72.36 per unit at a recent Indian auction in which six foreign firms bagged most of the 2,000 MW of projects for which bids were called, people close to the development said. ReNew Power is the only Indian firm among the winners.&#10;The lowest tariff until now had been 72.44 per unit, reached in a Solar Corporation of India (SECI) auction in May 2017, and again in July 2018.&#10;SECI is the nodal agency through which the ministry of new and renewable energy conducts wind and solar power auctions. It declined to confirm the winning tar iffs in the latest auction.&#10;According to the people cited earlier, Spain's Solarpack won 300 MW at 72.36 per unit, while Italy's Enel Green Power won 300MW at 72.37 per unit. Germany's IB Vogt won 300 MW at the same tariff. Canadian developer AMP Energy and New York-based Eden Renewables won 100MW and 300MW&#10;respectively, at 72.37 per unit. Ayana Renewable Power, which is backed by CDC Group (UK's development finance institution), won 300 MW at 72.38 per unit. Renew Power, an Indian company largely backed by foreign investors, won 400 MW at72.38 per unit. The latest SECI tender had received an overwhelming response last week, with bids for more than 5,000 MW Developers are free to choose where they want to set up their project in the country "Solar equipment costs have been falling very sharply in the last six months because of Covid-related demand depression around the world," said Vinay Rustagi, managing director of renewable energy consultancy firm Bridge to India.&#10;Developers are also anxious to win new projects because of the slowdown in power demand and the slow pace of auctions, he said.&#10;"Vanilla solar tenders are becoming rare, as there is greater push for more complex roundthe-clock and peak power schemes,  Rustagi said.&#10;&#10;</description>

            <description> THE HEAVY engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) Tuesday flagged off the final assembly of a cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber to Cadarache in France. The company has already delivered the base section, lower cylinder and upper cylinder for the cryostat.&#10;The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#10;L&#38;T Heavy Engineering won the contract from ITER India, a wingof the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012. It was conducted in collaboration with seven countries indudinglndia and the project outlay is around $20 billion. L&#38;T's scope ofworkfor the cryostat was&#10;L&#38;T non-executive chairman AM Naik said he was apprehensive of bidding for the cryostat contract. File&#10;to the tune of Rs 1,300 crore.&#10;Explaining the project's importance, Anil V Parab, executive vice-president &#38; head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering said this is the first time a 500-megawatt reactor has been built which is the commercial demonstration of fusion power.&#10;L&#38;T non-executive chairman&#10;AM Naik on Tuesday was quoted by FTI as saying he was apprehensive of bidding for the Rs 1,338-crore ITER's cryostat contract for the world's largest experimental thermo-nuclear fusion reactor in Cadarache as it was considered as "too risky a bet&#10;L&#38;T's management bandwidth and teams executing such an enormous project and that too far from India ...this we have never done nor had done before. Hence the project was perceived to be too risky, Naik said duringthe virtual flag-off ceremony of the final assembly at L&#38;T's Hazira manufacturing complex However, Naik called it moment of pride for India and Larsen &#38;Toubro.&#10;SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, said, "This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat atthe project site... and eventually lead to the demonstration of large scale feasibility of fusion power."&#10;&#10;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T completes cryostat for global fusion project</title>
            <link>https://www.netindia123.com/articles/showdetails.asp?id=3584863&#38;n_date=20200630</link>
            <description> The heavy engineering arm of Larsen and Toubro, has completed the final assembly of cryostat, the largest stainless steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;p&#62;It's an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion sector as well as a moment of pride for the'Make in India' initiative, said L&#38;T, India's leading engineering, construction, technology, manufacturing and financial services conglomerate, in a statement, here on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ceremony was attended through video link by International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Global's Director-General Bernard Bigot, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman K.N. Vyas, ITER-India Project Director U.K. Baruah, NITI Aayog Member V.K. Saraswat, L&#38;T Group Chairman A.M. Naik, CEO &#38; MD of L&#38;T S.N. Subrahmanyan and others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Today, in Hazira, we celebrate the completion of fabrication of all segments, including the Top Lid, of the cryostat. We achieved it under these challenging conditions," said Bigot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Subrahmanyan said it was a proud moment for L&#38;T as it had achieved another milestone in the development of world's largest stainless steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high quality, high-precision assemblies to the ITER, he said and added, it would pave the way for installation of cryostat at the project site in France and "lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"It has empowered India to move towards Atmanirbhar Bharat plan by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology," the L&#38;T CEO said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly referred as the Top Lid, weighing 650 tonnes, is to be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER at a reactor pit in southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat, which provides cooling to the fusion reactor and keeps very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering was divided into three aspects. First, the company was to manufacture assemblies at its Hazira complex. The second aspect involved building a temporary workshop at the project site in Cadarache, France, for the assembly of various sectors. And finally, to integrate the cryostat with the Tokamak Reactor building.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With the flagging off, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has completed the manufacturing work planned in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;--IANS san/pcj&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;( 391 Words)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;2020-06-30-16:18:10 (IANS)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>SDMC signs MoU to generate power from waste at Okhla landfill site</title>
            <link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-signs-mou-to-generate-power-from-waste-at-okhla-landfill-site/story-lV2oih2g7VzOcwWsQFbZrM.html</link>
            <description> New Delhi: The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Oil and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to set up a pilot project for Waste to Wealth Plant' at its Okhla landfill site.&#60;p&#62; The MoU was signed in the presence of Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, Union minister of power RK Singh, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, SDMC mayor Anamika and SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti through video conferencing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bharti said the project will address the problem of disposal of municipal solid waste. Under this project, the plant will process 50 tonnes per day of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) segregated from municipal solid waste to produce Syn Gas. This Syn gas will be utilised to generate about 1MW electricity. For this project, SDMC will provide one acre land in Okhla landfill site on lease to Indian Oil for setting up the plant. The south corporation will purchase the power generated from the plant at a mutually agreed rate. We will able to save an amount of Rs.2.6 crore due to the purchase of power from the proposed plant, Bharti said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The commissioner further said that there would be an investment of 50% each by the Indian Oil and NTPC towards the capital cost in setting up of the plant through a consortium. Indian Oil will facilitate the technology for the plant and identify technology partner for Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) of the plant and will handle the operation of the proposed facility. The NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Union minister Pradhan also stated that Delhi generates 10,000 tonnes waste every day and it is a daunting challenge to manage and process the entire quantity of waste. He said that setting up such relevant and much needed plant will go a long way in the production of enriched organic manure, generation of electricity and treatment of effluent waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Anamika, mayor SDMC, stated that the initiative will definitely help the municipality in achieving 100% waste processing. In future, we will try to replicate such plants in other areas also. This plant is an indigenous solution for the problem of solid waste, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Property tax date extended&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The South and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have extended the date of submission of property tax with 15% rebate by one month till July 31, 2020. Officials of north and south corporations have said that the decision has been taken to facilitate taxpayers who could not deposit property tax availing the benefit of 15% for timely payment. Earlier, the last for tax submission to avail the benefit was June 30, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>COLUMN-Britain accelerating transition to electric cars: Kemp</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/global-oil-kemp/column-britain-accelerating-transition-to-electric-cars-kemp-idINL8N2E7527</link>
            <description> LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Britain's transition from petroleum to electricity in road transport is accelerating, albeit from a low base, and will start to have a significant impact on oil consumption towards the end of the decade.&#60;p&#62; Ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) accounted for nearly 7% of all new cars registered in Britain during the first quarter of 2020, up from just over 2% in the same periods in 2019 and 2018.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ULEVs, mostly battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a smaller number using hydrogen fuel cells, emit less than 75 grammes of carbon dioxide from the tailpipe per kilometre travelled.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There are now almost 280,000 ultra-low emission cars registered, up from less than 100,000 three years ago (Vehicle licensing statistics, U.K. Department for Transport, June 30).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the end of March, there were almost 110,000 battery electric cars and 155,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars, with small numbers using other ULEV technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Policy support is gradually switching from hybrids to pure battery electric cars to maximise the reduction in tailpipe emissions (Electric vehicles and infrastructure, House of Commons, March 25).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the past year, registrations of battery electric cars have overtaken hybrids for the first time, which should result in a further electrification of the fleet over the next few years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ultra-low emission cars of all types still make up less than 1% of the 32 million cars registered but the proportion has almost tripled in the last three years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; New registrations for ultra-low emission cars have been rising at an annual rate of 30-40% compared with growth of just 1-2% for all cars, which implies rapidly rising market penetration ( tmsnrt.rs/3eNmf7E&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; S-CURVE&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; New technology products (motor cars, refrigerators, and televisions) and services (gas, electricity, telephones, water and sewerage) have tended to spread through a population following an S-shaped logistic curve.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The initial invention is often followed by decades of small-scale use and trial-and-error, before the technology rapidly diffuses on a much larger scale. Eventually the market becomes saturated, limiting further spreading.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Fitting S-curves to emerging new technologies is risky: some subsequently fail to reach take-off or are overtaken by rival technologies and end up reaching only a fraction of the potential number of users.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Estimating the diffusion rate that underlies the logistic curve is especially prone to error in the early years when the number of current users is very low and growth rates are volatile.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Nonetheless, there are good theoretical reasons to assume the transition to electric vehicles will follow a logistic curve, and the observed growth in ULEV market share in Britain does appear to fit a logistic curve.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If ultra-low emission cars diffuse through the population following the fitted logistic curve, they will account for about 25% of all new registrations by 2027, 50% by 2031 and 75% by 2035.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The implied transition to electric-powered vehicles is broadly consistent with the government's stated ambition of ensuring at least 50%, and as much as 70%, of all new car sales are ultra-low emission vehicles by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The ambition was set out by the Department for Transport two years ago in a major strategy paper (The Road to Zero: Next steps towards cleaner road transport and delivering our industrial strategy, July 9, 2018).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The timetable for the transition is also consistent with the government's announced plan to prohibit the sale of gasoline and diesel cars from 2040.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The ban on gasoline and diesel car sales could be brought forward to 2035 under proposals the government has published for consultation (Decarbonising transport: setting the challenge, U.K. Department for Transport, March 26, 2020).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Given the current trajectory of ultra-low emission vehicle sales, this timetable appears realistic, requiring only a modest amount of policy intervention to force the transition.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; FUEL USE&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Even if ultra-low emission cars reach 50% of all new registrations by 2031, their share of the total fleet will still be much lower because of the number of older vehicles still in use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But there is still likely to be a small, significant oil consumption by the end of the decade, becoming much larger and more significant by the end of the 2030s, given the turnover in the vehicle fleet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Britain's oil consumption represents a very small and diminishing share of the world total, just 1.5%, so the implied transition from petroleum to electric cars is too small to matter on a global scale.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But the transition is likely typical for a range of other high-income countries in Europe, which will have a big impact in aggregate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More important is whether the big three petroleum markets (China, the United States and India) see a similar shift towards electric vehicles over the next two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; China is likely to electrify road transport at least as fast as Britain, given its limited domestic oil production and dependence on imports, which policymakers have identified as a top strategic vulnerability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Beijing has made the production and diffusion of electric vehicles a priority on both national security and environmental grounds to reduce oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The transition in the United States remains more uncertain, given the country's large domestic oil production and political disagreements over energy policy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Future Democratic administrations are likely to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles while future Republican administrations may offer less policy support.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; India, which is the smallest but fastest growing of the big three petroleum markets, seems more likely to follow China given its similar dependence on imported oil.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For petroleum producers, including OPEC, the international oil majors and U.S. shale firms, the transition to electric vehicles is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumption and prices in the next five years (2021-2025).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But the transition will emerge as a small but significant factor in petroleum markets over the five-to-10 year time frame (2026-2030) and a decisive factor in the following decade (2031-2040).

            <title>MoU signed before inviting tender to build e-buses</title>
            <link>https://english.madhyamam.com/en/kerala/2020/jun/30/mou-signed-inviting-tender-build-e-buses</link>
            <description> Our Correspondent / June 30, 2020, 9:58 pm Alex Naef, Susan Von Sury and K.R. Jyothilal are seen in this photo published on Hess AG website&#60;p&#62; Kozhikode: The state government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a Swiss company for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) on e-Mobility, a project estimated at Rs. 4500 crores, before inviting tenders. The government signed an understanding with Hess AG, a renowned name in building electric buses, in 2019 June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The signing ceremony of MoU has also been published on the website of the company, in which Transport Secretary K.R. Jyothilal also appears. The understanding was signed at Evolve', an Electric Mobility Expo held in Kochi last year, between Kerala Automobiles Ltd. and Hess to build electric buses. The project is to build e-buses partnering with a private firm in Kottayam, which builds chassis for heavy vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, the fact that Price Water Coopers (PwC) was commissioned later to prepare DPR for the e-Mobility scheme has raised eyebrows. Minister AK Sasindran himself confirmed that the order regarding DPR was issued by the Transport Secretary in November 2019. It is puzzling that the PwC has not so far laid down the DPR. The firm was asked to prepare DPR within a month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The project envisioned building 10 lakh electric buses within a span of three years. Two lakh two wheelers, 50,000 autos, 1,000 goods vehicles, 3,000 buses and 100 boats were announced by the Chief Minister to build in e-platform. The government decided to promote electric vehicles deploying the crores of rupees allowed by the central government. Hess AG CEO Alex Naef was among others who signed the understanding.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company was attracted to Kerala by Susan Von Sury, a female legislator in Switzerland who has family roots in Thiruvambady, Kozhikode.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The Centre has announced auctioning of coal mines for commercial exploitation and sale, but the mine-bearing states have been apprehensive of this.&#60;p&#62;Some have pointed to environmentally sensitive zones in which these mines are located while others fear a revenue shortfall. In an interview with, Union Minister for Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs says he will replace mines from the auction if chief ministers object but they should understand this will change the economic situation in states.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The idea of commercial mining did not germinate suddenly. It was there and the prime minister made it part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package. Before that, we had discussion with states, who are the stakeholders. Before announcing the auction, we had shared the list of close to 100 proposed mines and made enquiries if the industry was interested. We selected only those mines in which there was a substantial interest. Secondly, in just days of commencing the auction process, there have been 329 registrations, 26 tender documents have been sold, and 10 people have registered themselves for visiting the mines. The pandemic will remain for a few months but whatever investment has to come in these mines will come after eight-nine months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some small teething issues have emerged. We are replacing one mine in Maharashtra because it lies in an eco-sensitive zone. So the auction process could be extended for another 30 days. The process takes 90-120 days. Mines which are ready to produce will take another seven-nine months to be operational. By then, Im confident the Indian and world economies will revive. For the mines offered, 5-15 people have shown an interest in each mine.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The concept of no-go"areas was born during the UPA regime, which itself abandoned it. Jairam Ramesh as environment minister gave permission for mining in no-go" areas. Now it is low, medium &#38; high conservative"areas. In high conservative", there will be more restrictions but mining is allowed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ramesh is confused and changed his stance every few years. First he said coalfields would never be opened up for mining. Then three years later, he gave clearance for three blocks. He had earlier introduced the concept of no go"areas. Then later he accepted his mistake and said these coal blocks belonged to supercritical thermal power plants which emitted less greenhouse gas and should be approved.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We have to decide whether we should import coal and burn or produce our own coal, provide employment, and save on foreign exchange. Without any question, an environment balance should be maintained. We never compromised on environment issues but at the same time we need energy for the growth of economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The environment ministry, in consultation with states, will determine whether we can allot these mines. I had a detailed discussion with the Chhattisgarh chief minister and he said there was a problem with four mines. If the state government wants, we will replace these mines. Both the Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh chief ministers have supported commercial coal mining.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I would like to apprise the states about this when this pandemic is in some control. Only those mines in which is an interest have been put up for auction. Such apprehensions are flawed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Whatever revenue comes will go to the states. Initially there will be a coal index and then a regulator. Having a regulator will take some time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coal India has planted a hundred million trees in mining areas. Private players too will have to take the responsibility of environment protection.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China is producing 3.5 billion tonnes of coal a year. The US is producing oil. These countries cannot give us sermons on climate change. We are working towards all climate change commitments we have made on the global stage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We are also doing coal gasification liquefaction and coal bed methane which are all less polluting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha on Tuesday wrote to Secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation P.S. Kharola urging him to stop domestic flights from high prevalence places to Kolkata.&#60;p&#62;West Bengal is witnessing a steep rise in cases...Accordingly, I request you not to schedule any flight to Kolkata or Bagdogra from high prevalence places viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai, Indore, Ahmedabad and Surat for two weeks from July, Mr Sinha said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been demanding the ban.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During the day, Ms. Banerjee threatened to acquire 6,000 private buses in Kolkata through the imposition of the National Disaster Management Act. If the owners do not operate buses by Wednesday, we will be left with no option but to acquire them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Sinha also wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla seeking permission to invoke the Act. The State had proposed 15,000 aid to private bus owners but they were not willing to bring the vehicles on the streets. The owners are demanding a hike in the fares and commuters in Kolkata and suburbs have been having a tough time in reaching their destinations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, Ms. Banerjee opposed the Centres decision to bring cooperative banks under the RBI. This is the only thing that we have in our control. The Centre should not take it away. Our government has decided to write to the NITI Aayog chief against it, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Indias solar power tariffs hit a record low of  2.36 per unit</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/india-s-solar-power-tariffs-hit-a-record-low-of-rs-2-36-per-unit-11593534636561.html</link>
            <description> According to government officials, the lowest bid was placed by Spain Solarpack Corporaci&#195;&#179;n Tecnol&#195;&#179;gica, S.A. This also assumes importance given that the rapid pace of clean energy capacity addition by India&#60;p&#62;New Delhi: Indias solar power tariffs hit a record low of Rs2.36 per unit during a bid conducted by state run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to government officials, the lowest bid was placed by Spain Solarpack Corporaci&#195;&#179;n Tecnol&#195;&#179;gica, S.A., with Italy's Enel Group Avikaran Surya India Private Ltd, Canadian firm AMP Solar Groups India unitAMP Energy Green Private Ltd, France EDEN Renewables and Ib Vogt Singapore Pte ltd placing the second lowest tariff bid of 2.37 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;UK CDC Group-backed Ayana Renewable Power and Goldman Sachs backed ReNew Power placed the third lowest bid of 2.37 per unit each.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While the previously recorded low solar bid was of  2.44 per unit in May 2017, the bids for the 2000 mega watt (MW) capacity were called in the backdrop of Indias move to impose basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar cells, modules, and inverters from 1 August and its economy undergoing a two-month lockdown, the worlds largest and strictest, to contain the virus that originated in Wuhan, China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Heartening to note that majority of the winners are foreign companies, in true spirit of Invest in India call by Hon'ble @PMOIndia. This showcases India as an attractive investment destination," power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While any tariff barrier will lead to an increase in electricity tariffs, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government plans to allow a pass-through in power tariffs for projects awarded before the basic customs duty is imposed. Going forward India plans to impose more tariff and non-tariff barriers to promote domestic manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 fails to halt the aggressive RE growth story, with a historically lowest tariff of Rs.2.36/unit achieved in 2000 MW ISTS( Tranche-IX) solar bid conducted by @SECI_Ltd,"Singh said in another tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These low tariff bids come in the backdrop of the Andhra Pradesh scrapping the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous Telugu Desam Party-led government, that led to an outcry by global investors forcing New Delhi to propose setting up an Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority to enforce PPAs in the draft amendments to the Electricity Act, 2003.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The bids comes in the backdrop of debt financing for green energy projects drying up with large Indian banks declining to fund projects that have committed to sell power at less than Rs3 per unit. The banks have been wary of lending to developers as they suspect the viability of projects that have agreed to sell power at rock-bottom tariffs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This also assumes importance given that the rapid pace of clean energy capacity addition by India. Clean energy projects now account for more than a fifth of Indias installed power generation capacity. India has 34.6 GW of solar power, with an aim to have 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022. The country is seeking additional clean energy investment of around $80 billion till 2022, growing more than threefold to $250 billion during 2023-30.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Green shoots had sprouted in the economy, since the country began easing restrictions after a lengthy lockdown. India started unlocking its economy in phases beginning 8 June, allowing more economic activity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The results were declared within seven days of the bid opening. The last date for bid submission was 22 June, with the bids being opened on 23 June,"said a government official cited above requesting anonymity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>L&#38;T achieves milestone in manufacturing cryostat for Global Fusion Project</title>
            <link>https://in.news.yahoo.com/l-t-achieves-milestone-manufacturing-cryostat-global-fusion-115442233.html</link>
            <description> Hazira (Gujarat) [India], June 30 (ANI: The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of cryostat -- the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;p&#62; "This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India initiative," the company said in a statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; India is among the seven elite countries funding the 20 billion dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme at Cadarache in France. This is one of the world's largest research project that seeks to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Today, in Hazira, we celebrate with you the completion of fabrication of all the segments of cryostat, including most recently the segments of the cryostat lid -- again achieved under these challenging conditions," said ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot. L&#38;T's CEO and Managing Director S N Subrahmanyan said the company used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Subrahmanyan said the initiative has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The cryostat assembly referred to as the top lid weighing 650 metric tonnes will be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER in a reactor pit in southern France. L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; L&#38;T's heavy engineering business won the prestigious contract in 2012. ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, is the overall in-charge of the Indian participation for this ambitious mega scientific project.

            <title>All Apps Must Adhere To India's Data Integrity, Privacy: Niti Aayog</title>
            <link>https://odishatv.in/nation/all-apps-must-adhere-to-indias-data-integrity-privacy-niti-aayog-459725</link>
            <description> New Delhi: Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Tuesday said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy and sovereignty, a day after the government banned 59 apps.&#60;p&#62; Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; They must be transparent in origin &#38; final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps, Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Indians will leverage the strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about the misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures, the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (PTI)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More On Chinese App Ban:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Byton to suspend production for reorganization</title>
            <link>https://technocodex.com/byton-to-suspend-production-for-reorganization/</link>
            <description> SHANGHAI  China-based electric car startup Byton, which has planned sales in the U.S., said Tuesday it will suspend production starting July 1 to conduct a reorganization of the automaker after being hit by the coronavirus pandemic.&#60;p&#62;The company, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, said it was also actively raising funds to address issues relating to unpaid staff salaries and that it hoped to start paying employees from July.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The suspension is set to last six months, closely held Byton told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg News.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new coronavirus epidemic has brought great challenges to Bytons financing and production operations, the company said in a statement. After careful consideration and joint consultations with our shareholders and management, we have decided to, from July 1, kickstart a plan to lower employee costs and promote the companys strategic reorganization.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton produces all of its vehicles at a plant in Nanjing. Starting Wednesday it will suspend most operations in China, where its activities include research and development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In April, industry website Electrek reported that Byton had put hundreds of employees from its Santa Clara facility in California on furlough.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton was launched in September 2017 by Future Mobility Corp, a company co-founded by former BMW and Nissan executives, and also has software and design facilities in the United States and Germany.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton earlier this year said it planned to launch sales of its first product, the M-Byte electric crossover, in Germany, Switzerland, Norway, France, the Netherlands and Sweden in the second half of 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The automaker said in November it received licenses to sell the vehicle in California in a move that Byton said paves the way for North American sales in 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton is among a series of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturing startups that have emerged in recent years to challenge foreign companies like Tesla.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China, which has been eager to curb smog and spur its own auto industry, has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles to account for 25 percent of auto sales by 2025, up from around 5 percent currently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the appetite to fund such startups began falling last year and has been dealt a further, heavy blow by the coronavirus pandemic, leaving a number fighting to survive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In May, sales of NEVs fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, Chinas largest auto industry association said. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bloomberg contributed to this report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

            <title>Response to commercial auctions good; No CIL privatisation or hiving off of units: Pralhad Joshi</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/response-to-commercial-auctions-good-no-cil-privatisation-or-hiving-off-of-units-pralhad-joshi/76716992</link>
            <description> Q&#38;A with Pralhad Joshi, Minister for Coal and Mines&#60;p&#62;New Delhi: Commercial coal blocks have received a strong response, with many bidders already buying tender documents, according to&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Pralhad Joshi, Indias minister for coal and mines. In an interview with ETs Sarita C Singh, he said that over the next five years, coal should be available unconditionally to power consumers, and that Coal India will remain the largest player and its subsidiaries will not be listed. Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since 2015, commercial coal auctions were being delayed due to lack of demand. Are you not worried about the timing of the auctions since there are fears that companies might hold on to cash?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For auctions, already 329 registrations have been made and 26 tender documents have been sold. Ten companies within a week have submitted they want to visit the mines. We had put on our website list of coal mines available with us and we had sought interest from companies. We have chosen the best of the blocks that received good interest. For the 41 coal blocks under auction, there were minimum five bidders and upto 11 bidders. After coal mines auction started in 2015, this is the best ever response. The bidders will have a minimum 6-7 months to start the investments. We had a technical session in which a total 1,140 people participated, of which 50-55 were foreigners. I am not saying all of these will participate in the auctions, but I am quite confident that this tranche will go a long way.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Jharkhand government has moved the Supreme Court challenging commercial coal auctions and their environmental impact. Will this impact the bidding?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In his letter to us, Jharkhand chief minister has welcomed coal auctions but he has some apprehensions. I am trying to convince him and I have no hesitation in saying that without state cooperation we cant run. We are already late in comparison to other countries. Major domestic and foreign players are expected to participate in the auctions and we dont want them to feel that Jharkhand is not a safe place. As soon as the situation stabilises, I would like to apprise Jharkhand chief minister of the issue and discuss it with him. Previously also we had detailed eight rounds of consultations at various levels with states. Home minister Amit Shah ji has already requested cooperation from the Jharkhand government. I have also responded to the chief minister.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The power sector has been demanding delinking of fuel supply agreements with power purchase agreements so that plants which do not have such tie-ups can get coal. What are your views?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fuel supply agreements and power purchase agreements are long-term contracts and these are at a competitive price. But I wish in the next five years, coal should be available at a very competitive price to everybody. But now this is not the stage. When you have good quality and quantity of coal, then this open markets system is fully accepted. When Coal India achieves one billion tonnes production, we can think of it. Because of Covid, we have been forced to reduce coal production. Coal India has a target to produce 710 million tonnes this year but because of the low demand due to Covid it may have to reduce the target.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What will be the role of Coal India after private commercial coal mining starts? Will it be able to stand the competition?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coal India is the biggest coal producer in the world. Last year it ended with 607 million tonnes output against 630 million tonnes target due to Covid. As on date, Indias coal need is 1100 million tonnes and by 2023-24, the assessment is 1500-1600 million tonnes demand. On one hand I am trying to promote Coal India so that it grows, improves technology and raises output and at the same time we are trying to substitute imports through commercial coal mining.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coal Indias technical capability is quite good and they are one of the low-cost coal producers in the world. But at the same time, some technology and some systemic changes need to be brought in for more transparency and efficiency in administration. There is always scope for improvement. Even when these auctioned coal mines reach their peak rated capacity, they will produce 225 million tonnes, remaining who will supply? We are dependent on Coal India. It will be our dominant players and it will be strengthened.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;PSUs in various sectors are being identified for privatisation. Can Coal India be in the list? Or is the government thinking to separate and list coal subsidiaries?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There is absolutely no question of Coal India privatisation because it is in a very strategic sector. Without electricity there can be no growth in the economy and for that we need Coal India. We are clear that Coal India will be the dominant player and commercial mining is only a substitute to the shortfall. We will not be hiving off the subsidiaries, we are very clear on this. Experts say there will be another 30-35 years of active participation by the coal sector. Before that Coal India should reach the best possible heights.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has begun working towards a coal exchange. When will it begin operations?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We are floating an idea of coal exchange. When we will have a good amount of stock at our hand, people should have the liberty to purchase whatever grade of coal they need at a competitive price. If we can do it in power and other commodities, why cant it be done in coal?When there will be no shortage of coal, there will be a coal exchange. It is premature to talk about it now. It will take sometime, but its in my plan. For any exchange, the commodity should be abundantly available.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Apps against whom action is taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indians will leverage strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;advertisement&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about the misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures," the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;READ MORE | Coronavirus in India: Our containment strategy same as China's, says NITI Ayog member&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;READ MORE | Arogya Setu app, Niti Aayog CEO face RSS fire over app links to e-pharma companies&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO WATCH | NITI Aayog pitches for 'Champion States', CEO Amitabh Kant says need to name and shame them&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>CCS Meeting: India Reaches Out To Friendly Nations, Seeks Early Delivery of Weapons</title>
            <link>http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2020/07/ccs-meeting-india-reaches-out-to.html</link>
            <description> The Ministry of Defence (MoD) officials have been reaching out to countries including the US, France, Russia and others in an effort to urge them to deliver earlier than the scheduled date&#60;p&#62;While Israel is expected to send a new air defence system Iron Dome for deployment in border areas, US-based BAE Systems are expected to ship in Howitzers, more ammunition from Russia and the US.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Though China has deployed S-400 along the border to protect against Indian missiles, during his recent visit to Moscow, defence minister Rajnath Singh had urged his counterpart to expedite the delivery of the equipment India is buying from there.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The US is already helping with intelligence inputs to India and has also asked India its latest needs in view of the tension.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Under the draft DPP shared publicly in March this year, India has now the option to lease critical military equipment from a friendly nation. A new clause has been introduced under which equipment including warships, transport aircraft can be leased.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While India has already acquired 155MM Excalibur artillery ammunition from the US, which has the capability to hit targets almost 50 km away, there is a plan to acquire more PGMs (precision-guided munitions). This can also be fired at extended ranges. In India, this is being used for M-777 ultra-light Howitzers which have been made in the US by the BAE Systems and are locally here in India. The Indian Army will have seven regiments of the M-777 Ultra-Light Howitzers which are expected to be deployed along the borders with China and Pakistan. The army will be using the Excalibur ammunition in the K-9 Vajra 155 mm/52 calibre self-propelled tracked howitzer too. This 47-ton K-9 Vajra is a modified version of the Samsung-Techwin K-9 155 mm/52-caliber and is now being made in India in a venture with L&#38;T.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In case there is an attack the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has delegated financial powers to the Service Headquarters and also emergency powers have been given to the Vice Chiefs of respective Service HQs. According to the MoD this power will enable in expediting the procurements of weapon systems and ammunition.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This has been acquired for the units which are deployed along the Line of Control with Pakistan where artillery firing is a regular feature and this ammunition once-fired has the capability to be busted in the air using different fuses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To further strengthen India-US Military ties, on Monday two US senators introduced legislations seeking joint research and development in the military sector with India. And have urged the Pentagon to focus on areas including Air Launched Small Unmanned Aerial Systems, Intelligence Surveillance, Lightweight Small Arms Technologies, and Targeting and Reconnaissance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Both countries are already focusing on deepening their military ties and India has been looking to the US to buy state of the military equipment. Both countries are involved in various joint as well as tri-service exercises.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;French Defence Minister Florence Parly has written to defence minister Rajnath Singh expressing condolences on the recent death of 20 Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;She has also expressed readiness to meet him in Delhi to follow up on the discussions between the two countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Domestic gas pricing reform on cards</title>
            <link>https://www.navhindtimes.in/domestic-gas-pricing-reform-on-cards/</link>
            <description> In one of the last reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government is set to free up pricing of all domestically produced natural gas that would help scale up local production from fields of ONGC, OIL, Reliance and Vedanta and help create a uniform gas market where the fuel is freely tradable on exchanges.&#60;p&#62;The development comes soon after the launch of countrys first online delivery-based gas trading platform  India Gas Exchange which is expected to play a big role in competitive price discovery for the natural gas that will come from different parts of the globe and from within India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Government sources said that discussions on lifting price restrictions on locally produced natural gas have started again and soon a decision would be taken about the timing of the new reform initiative. The current timing is considered ideal to free up gas prices as oil market after witnessing extreme volatility in March and April have stabilised and prices have remained soft and stable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A panel led by the NITI Aayog Vice Chairman has also suggested free-market pricing for natural gas produced from all fields to boost domestic output. Now with gas exchange also in place, the idea to expand on the idea of creating a gas based economy has gained strength: We are looking at all proposals on bringing out domestic gas production from pricing regulations. A cabinet note proposing the changes would soon be finalised so that new system is put in place at the earliest,a said a government official privy to the development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also indicated towards the reform initiative last week when at a function he said that India will gradually end controls on gas pricing as it seeks to attract foreign investment and technology to lift local output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, any move to completely lift price regulation in the gas sector will be done gradually as has been suggested by the Kelkar Committee. This would mean that the present system of regulated gas pricing for domestic production would continue for at least three more years but during the period producers would be given freedom to sell a portion of the total output under negotiated pricing deals (market determined) with their customers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The NDA governments reform initiatives ever since coming to power has already allowed free gas pricing for production coming from small and marginal blocks, difficult high pressure/deep water blocks and all production coming under the newly bid blocks under the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Policy (HELP).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the pricing and marketing of gas from Pre-NELP exploration blocks and those under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) is still regulated. This regulation will be lifted gradually, once the new policy is approved.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The current gas pricing method for pre-NELP and NELP blocks is based on a 2014 government-set formula that takes average rates from global trading hubs to determine domestic prices twice a year  in April and then in October. Under the formula, the current gas price is at $ 2.39 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the six-month period beginning April 1. Gas producers have been critical of this low pricing that adversely impacts investments in the upstream sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Its about time when government frees up gas pricing, if it is serious about developing a gas based economy in the country. Apart from lifting pricing restrictions on domestic gas, the government should also do away with price caps for market determined gas price. This would enable market forces and competition to offer best available prices to consumers, said a senior official of a private sector oil and gas explorer who did not wish to be named.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At present, producers can charge market rates for gas from deep sea and other difficult fields but rates must stay below a government-prescribed ceiling thats linked to the prices of alternative fuels. The price ceiling is currently at $5.61 per mmBtu. The new policy will look into this ceiling price as well, sources said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is looking at investor friendly policies in oil and gas sector to attract investments that has remained miniscule for last several years. Due to this, domestic oil production has stagnated while gas production has not picked up in a big way.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Villages in Mlaya, as mark of protest, demand to be part of Bangladesh</title>
            <link>https://meghalayatimes.info/villages-in-mlaya-as-mark-of-protest-demand-to-be-part-of-bangladesh/</link>
            <description> SHILLONG, June 30: Four villages located along the Indo-Bangla border in East Jaintia Hills district have demanded the Centre and state governments to allow them to be part of Bangladesh.&#60;p&#62;The demand came as a mark of protest against the failure of the government to construct the Rymbai-Bataw-Borkhat-Sonapur road, which has been left in a pathetic and deplorable condition for the past many years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The decision was taken at meeting convened by the four villages  Hingaria, Huroi, Lahalein and Lejri  having a population of more than 5,000. The meeting has discussed the course of action against the governments apathy towards the demand of the people of the area.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The meeting has unanimously decided that it is better for the government to give the four villages and its 5000 plus population to Bangladesh if it is not willing to construct the road for us, Spokesperson of the four villages Kynjaimon Amse said in a statement issued on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The four villages have also decided to write to the Government of Bangladesh to request for construction of the road for us since the Government of India and Government of Meghalaya have failed to understand our problems, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prima facie it is clear that the lives of the border population do not matter at all to the Government and we are being used just for votes. If the government really considers us as Indians and is serious about our problems, the Government should immediately address the road problem and interim measures should be taken up to ease the road problem failing which the people will have no choice but to take extreme steps, the statement further stated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amse said that the four village have been moving from pillar to post to draw the attention of the Government to construct and built the road.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We have been writing to all Government functionaries right from the Deputy Commissioner to the Chief Minister and Governor, but all we got was false promise. We have also been writing to the PMO, Home Ministry, NITI Aayog, Finance Ministry, NEC and many other offices of the Union Government for intervention, however even they are not interested to see our needs, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He informed that the matter was also taken by the Meghalaya High Court and National Human Rights Commission but the governments at both level have been reluctant to the needs of the people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said the proposal worth Rs 123 Crore for construction of the road have been lying with the DoNER Ministry since April 2019, however till date the DONER Ministry have not even discussed the proposal, hence the same is not approved till date.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The CM and Dy. CM when we met them have assured that the project will be approved; however all the assurance has shown no result. It only seems that the State Government is not serious about the road and did not take up the matter with the DoNER Ministry for consideration, Amse alleged.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The spokesperson said that the absence of a proper road has in fact violated the very fundamental right to Life of the people and also the basic human rights of the people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The present condition of the road is the root cause of all the problems of the people and unless the road is constructed the lives of the people will be just like mere animal existence. The people are being remembered just during elections and not after that.The people are frustrated and tired, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Maharashtra power min asks Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk for grievance redressal</title>
            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/maharashtra-power-min-asks-mahadiscom-161115964.html</link>
            <description> Mumbai, Jun 30 (PTI) Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut has asked state-owned Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk to address consumers' grievances after state electricity regulator MERC supported the utilities saying the bills charged by the discoms were as per the rules.&#60;p&#62;Following the consumers' complaints over inflated bills in June, MERC had sought clarification from the discoms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), later observed that the discoms had followed the rules of 'practise direction'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;'The present bills raised on actual meter readings are of the summer months where the consumption is normally high and the bills are always of higher amounts. Hence the balance amount payable after adjusting the average bill amounts for each of the three months March, April and May have led to higher bill that was issued in June,'it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MERC has also asked the utilities to provide the option of easy monthly instalments (EMI) and directed them to not disconnect power supply over non-payment of dues until grievances are redressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Raut directed Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk at divisional levels and also take initiatives to spread awareness among customers about the billing process by reaching out through various platforms like TV, radio, webinar and Facebook, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The state discom has decided to allow EMI option for three months for making the payment of the bill for June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Raut also asked the discom to grant a discount of two per cent to consumers who have promptly paid the bills for June as well as for those who would be paying the bill amount in lump sum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, those who had left for their villages during the lockdown period but have paid the bills for the three months on estimated basis, would get a refund in case they have paid extra amount.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Many consumers, including celebrities like Taapsee Pannu, Huma Qureshi, director Bijoy Nambiar and Renuka Shahane, took to Twitter to express concerns over the unexpected rise in their electricity bills during the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to MERC, all these utilities have dropped tariffs after the commission's revision order from April 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, since the country went into lockdown from March 25, following the COVID outbreak, the bills were calculated as per the previous readings. Adani Electricity reduced 12 per cent power tariff for all categories, followed by Tata Power (10 per cent), Mahadiscom (five per cent) and BEST (one per cent).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to MERC, only 6.35 lakh consumers across state were billed on actual meter readings during the lockdown, which is nearly 2.32 per cent of the total consumer base in the state.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, MERC has already approved installation of 7 lakh meters for Adani and 66,000 meters for Tata Power, it said.

            <title>Economy to recover following containment of COVID-19: Rajiv Kumar</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/economy-to-recover-following-containment-of-covid-19-rajiv-kumar-11593529524224.html</link>
            <description> 'India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers,'Rajiv Kumar added&#60;p&#62;India's economy will recover following the containment of COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing reforms would keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Kumar was speaking at the virtual launch of a report titled - Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities in India's Energy and Mobility Sectors - prepared by government think tank Niti Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"India's economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Last week, the IMF had projected a sharp contraction of 4.5 per cent for India's growth in 2020, citing unprecedented coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities, but had said the country is expected to bounce back in 2021 with a robust six per cent growth rate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," Kumar added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Several economists, brokerages and multilateral agencies have pointed to a deep contraction to india, triggered by the strict lockdown announced to stem the spread of deadly coronavirus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking at the event, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses - the transport and power sectors - and emerge stronger," Kant said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report said electric vehicles market in India may experience a shift as consumers seek affordable products amid COVID-19, and it could make manufacturers resume production for conventional vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Auto sales could decrease by as much as 45 per cent in the financial year 202021. EV production could be affected in the short term due to lower demand and supply-chain disruptions with BNEF estimating an 18 per cent decrease in global EV sales in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The EV market may experience other shifts. For example, there is an expectation of demand for more affordable EV products. This potential shift in consumer preferences may affect manufacturers' investment and production decisions. Ultimately, resuming production levels for conventional vehicles and EVs will depend on demand revival, supply-chain reactivation, and access to the labour force," the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lower disposable incomes and a tendency towards cash saving will lead to reduced demand for EV in the short-term, the report said, adding "some OEMs' customers are pushing back their EV business plans by two or more years".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the impact on EV supply chains, the report said, "There may be delays in EV production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles. Curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also highlighted the consequences of policy changes, stating "many state EV policies and e-bus projects may be delayed due to other priorities and social-distancing challenges".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stressing that the emerging situation and challenges in the context of COVID-19 has and will continue to disrupt business as usual in the mobility sector, the report said the impact of the pandemic on passenger and freight segments, as well as the auto industry, raise several questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These include whether the overall demand for mobility will fall in the short to medium-term, will ridership of public and shared transport modes decline and will private modes be preferred?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also pondered whether lack of auto sales will cause a severe hit to the supply chain and a growing call for self-sufficiency lead to a push to create local supply chains.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Will the Prime Minister's call for domestic manufacturing and localisation attract investments at a time when a recession is looming? Would the new mobility ecosystem propelled by startups be able to survive the crisis," it wondered.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>Saudi oil cuts take seven supertankers a day off the market</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/saudi-oil-cuts-take-seven-supertankers-a-day-off-the-market/articleshow/76716459.cms</link>
            <description> The Saudis are leading a push among major oil producers to cut supplies.&#60;p&#62; Commodity Summary&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; By Brian Wingfield&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Saudi Arabia seems to have made good on its promise to cut oil production by a record amount in June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Observed Saudi crude exports for this month fell to 5.7 million barrels a day through June 29, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the flows at the start of 2017. That compares with 6.2 million a day in May. It's a reduction equivalent to more than seven full supertankers over the course of the month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As the coronavirus ravages the global economy and saps energy demand, the Saudis are leading a push among major oil producers to cut supplies. State company Saudi Aramco agreed to cap output at 8.5 million barrels a day from May-July as part of an OPEC+ agreement to boost prices. The kingdom then went a step further, pledging to pump 1 million barrels daily less than that in June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While changes in exports and overall production aren't perfectly correlated, those curbs are showing up in the kingdom's shipments to the world's biggest economies. Flows to China, usually the largest purchaser, are down by about 45% on a monthly basis in June to 1.1 million barrels a day.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A recent flood of Saudi oil to the U.S. has dropped sharply. Flows in June have shriveled to 224,000 barrels a day, compared with almost 1.3 million in April, a three-year high. Only three supertankers and a smaller vessel were observed carrying Saudi crude to the U.S. in June, though more may emerge as some cargoes update their final destinations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tankers hauling a combined 17 million barrels of oil from the kingdom this month haven't yet indicated their ultimate port of call. It takes a ship roughly six weeks to sail from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. and about three weeks to China. Any vessel leaving for America now would arrive in the first half of August.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Wild Swings&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The volume of oil from Saudi Arabia has swung wildly in the past few months, in part due to the lingering effects of the kingdom's price war with Russia earlier in the year. Aramco slashed its official selling prices for oil in April and May, before raising them for this month, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed to limit output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One example of the whipsaw in Saudi flows is India, the closest major market. Riyadh's crude exports to India soared to more than a million barrels a day in April, when prices were at historic lows. Cargoes then fell by almost 50% in May. Shipments are set to increase this month, though not by as much as expected in an analysis of Saudi oil flows in mid-June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Exports to South Korea are also poised to climb to 1.1 million barrels a day, the highest in at least 3-1/2 years. Shipments to Japan are set to decline to about 610,000 barrels a day, the third consecutive monthly drop.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets .

            <title>Domestic gas pricing reform on cards, control may be lifted</title>
            <link>http://www.millenniumpost.in/business/domestic-gas-pricing-reform-on-cards-control-may-be-lifted-411462</link>
            <description> New Delhi: In one of the last reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government is set to free up pricing of all domestically produced natural gas that would help scale up local production from fields of ONGC, OIL, Reliance and Vedanta and help create a uniform gas market where the fuel is freely tradable on exchanges.&#60;p&#62;The development comes soon after the launch of country's first online delivery-based gas trading platform - India Gas Exchange which is expected to play a big role in competitive price discovery for the natural gas that will come from different parts of the globe and from within India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Government sources said that discussions on lifting price restrictions on locally produced natural gas have started again and soon a decision would be taken about the timing of the new reform initiative. The current timing is considered ideal to free up gas prices as oil market after witnessing extreme volatility in March and April have stabilised and prices have remained soft and stable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A panel led by the NITI Aayog Vice Chairman has also suggested free-market pricing for natural gas produced from all fields to boost domestic output. Now with gas exchange also in place, the idea to expand on the idea of creating a gas based economy has gained strength:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We are looking at all proposals on bringing out domestic gas production from pricing regulations. A cabinet note proposing the changes would soon be finalised so that new system is put in place at the earliest,a said a government official privy to the development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also indicated towards the reform initiative last week when at a function he said that India will gradually end controls on gas pricing as it seeks to attract foreign investment and technology to lift local output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, any move to completely lift price regulation in the gas sector will be done gradually as has been suggested by the Kelkar Committee. This would mean that the present system of regulated gas pricing for domestic production would continue for at least three more years but during the period producers would be given freedom to sell a portion of the total output under negotiated pricing deals (market determined) with their customers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The NDA government's reform initiatives ever since coming to power has already allowed free gas pricing for production coming from small and marginal blocks, difficult high pressure/deep water blocks and all production coming under the newly bid blocks under the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the pricing and marketing of gas from Pre-NELP exploration blocks and those under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) is still regulated. This regulation will be lifted gradually, once the new policy is approved. The current gas pricing method for pre-NELP and NELP blocks is based on a 2014 government-set formula that takes average rates from global trading hubs to determine domestic prices twice a year - in April and then in October.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Private coal mining may see weak investor sentiment: ICRA</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/private-coal-mining-may-see-weak-investor-sentiment-icra-11593538456629.html</link>
            <description> In FY2020, India imported 243 mt of coal from the seaborne market which entailed a hefty import bill of approximately US$ 21 billion&#60;p&#62;The prospects of commercial coal mining in India may be dimmer than initially expected because of the expected shift in Indias energy mix from fossil fuel-based power to renewable energy. The rollout of this government reform at a time when the economic outlook remains uncertain amid the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to weak investor sentiment, a report by credit ratings agency ICRA said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The domestic coal demand is estimated to increase at a modest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% between FY2021 and FY2027, ICRA estimated. This is much lower than the CAGR of 5.2% registered between FY2013 and FY2020. Given Coal Indias ambitious target to reach 1 billion tonne coal production by FY2024, private commercial miners would face stiff competition in gaining a foothold in the domestic market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a market, where an overwhelming majority of the domestic supply is controlled by Coal India and Singareni Collieries, affordability, dependability and consistency in coal quality would remain critical drivers that would determine if the existing coal customers decide to partly shift their sourcing to private commercial coal miners,"Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President &#38; Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA, said. Experienced players, who have the knowhow of efficiently operating a coal mining business, stand a better chance in making a dent in the market share of the existing players. Over the long-term, we believe that coal consumers are likely to benefit from increased competition in the domestic coal mining industry."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Around 94-95% of Coal Indias overall production comes from opencast mines, having attractive stripping ratios, which have an inherent cost advantage over their peers. Consequently, the operating cost for Coal Indias opencast mines reportedly stood at a competitive 833 per tonne in FY2019. Moreover, out of Coal Indias 582 million tonne (mt) of despatches in FY2020, around 89% has been supplied under long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) where the realisations remain very competitive. Given this cost competitiveness, as well as the arrangements already available to deliver coal to clients plants, threats to any loss in Coal Indias market share in the FSA segment remains low in ICRAs view; consequently the company would continue to dominate the sector in the foreseeable future. However, the geology of the mines belonging to The Singareni Collieries Company Limited remains less favourable, resulting in their operating costs being more than double that of Coal India. Consequently, vulnerability from increased competition remains much higher for Singareni Collieries, whose notified coal prices have an average premium of 40% - 125% over Coal Indias notified prices for various grades of coal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In FY2020, India imported 243 mt of coal from the seaborne market which entailed a hefty import bill of approximately US$ 21 billion. Out of this, around 52 mt was coking coal imports, which would be difficult to replace, given its limited domestic reserves. The balance 191 mt of imports was contributed by thermal coal, of which India has abundant reserves.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this regard, Roy added, Indias low-grade thermal coal imports stood at an estimated 110 mt in FY2020, and its import substitution with domestic coal remains a potential opportunity for private commercial miners. For the balance 75-80 mt of high-grade thermal coal imports, options to partly substitute such imports by supplying washed coal to the non-regulated sector also remains a potential area of growth for private commercial miners. Apart from import substitution, increasing market presence in the seaborne export market, and faster adoption of coal-gasification technologies may be other potential avenues of growth for private commercial coal miners."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>Clean energy will be a major driver of Indias economic recovery and international competitiveness</title>
            <link>https://www.internationalnewsandviews.com/clean-energy-will-be-a-major-driver-of-india%e2%80%99s-economic-recovery-and-international-competitiveness/</link>
            <description> New report highlights emerging challenges and opportunities for Indias transition to clean mobility and power systems in the context of Covid-19&#60;p&#62;New Delhi, NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) today released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities for Indias Energy and Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the countrys leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for Indias transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that Indias economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indias strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Clean energy will be a major driver of Indias economic recovery and international competitiveness, added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhousesthe transport and power sectorsand emerge stronger.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support Indias clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to Indias public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India, said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyones lives, said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report states that Indias transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Fly ash from Telangana power project to fill OCPs in Ramagundam</title>
            <link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fly-ash-from-telangana-power-project-to-fill-ocps-in-ramagundam/article31957343.ece</link>
            <description> The Singareni Collieries Company Limited, which has already started using the coal ash, the end product of NTPC Ramagundam, for stowing of the&#60;p&#62;underground mines after extraction of coal since the year 2011 onwards, has now decided to fill the Open Cast Projects with the ash in Ramagundam coal belt.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Accordingly, the Singareni management and NTPC Ramagundam are likely to sign an agreement for the supply of ash generated from the upcoming 1600 MWs (2 x 800) Telangana super thermal power project (TSTPP) to fill the OCPs in the Ramagundam region. Initially, it was decided to fill the OCP-4 in Ramagundam coal belt with TSTPP ash which is all set for commissioning by this year-end tentatively.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The filling of void in OCP mine is an environmentally friendly method of power generation. Subsequent to completion of coal excavation from Medipally open cast mine (OCP-4), it has created a huge void and needs to be filled from environment point of view. Coincidentally, the Telangana power project is coming up and the ash generated from it can be used for mine void backfilling.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New technology&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ash disposal system of Telangana project fully complies with CEA (Central Electricity Authority) guidelines and follows latest and environmentally friendly practices. For sending ash to the mine void, the NTPC is using a new technology called HCSD (High Concentration Slurry Disposal) which is safe, silent, and reliable without any ash spills and contamination. Through this, ash will be transported through small diameter-thick welded pipes in almost paste form in slower velocity by the positive displacement method. This will ensure almost nil chances of leakage and fugitive emission. This system uses less than 20 per cent water compared to a conventional system and thus makes more water available for Ramagundam, the official sources said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As the mine void is 150 metres below bed level of the river Godavari, there is no chance of contamination. Based on its technical feasibility, the NTPC is acquiring minimum possible private land for the proposed ash pipeline project going through Malkapur village, the sources said and added that if the ash had to be dumped in the ash pond, the NTPC requires several hundreds of acres of land and also cause air pollution with dust emission with the pond.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The officials have also said that the Union Ministry of Environment had also favoured utilisation of the fly ash generated by the thermal power projects for backfilling the mine voids and quarries. The filling of OCPs with ash of NTPC is the best form of protection of the environment, they maintained.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Public health officials do a reality check on Elon Musk's tweets about COVID-19 tests</title>
            <link>https://in.news.yahoo.com/public-health-officials-reality-check-034510409.html</link>
            <description> More Billionaire Elon Musk knows his stuff when it comes to rockets or electric cars. But does that translate into epidemiological expertise?&#60;p&#62;Not completely, according to Washington state's coronavirus trackers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Musk weighed in today with a Twitter response to a as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's appearance on CBS' Face the Nation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The situation is critical in many places across the United States, and all the happy talk and wishful thinking in the world is not going to wash that away, Inslee said. So we are taking very strong measures to get people to mask up. We know that's the solution from a health standpoint, and the way to reopen our economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Musk, in contrast, has voiced skepticism about some of the restrictions that were put in place in California to quell the spread of coronavirus. During an , the Tesla CEO said the state's stay-at-home order was fascist in nature. Give people back their goddamn freedom, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He was more measured in today's tweets, which called attention to the fact that the number of COVID-19 cases was rising dramatically while the number of coronavirus-related deaths was not:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &#38; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Elon Musk (@elonmusk)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Elon Musk (@elonmusk)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Musk didn't respond to our tweet asking about his sources, and he doesn't have a great track record when it comes to handicapping the pandemic. For example, in March he said the number of new cases would be by the end of April. (The seven-day moving average is and rising in the U.S.) But we think we see where he's coming from: It has to do with the nuts and bolts of testing, including concepts such as pre-test probability, test sensitivity and test specificity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let's take the example of Washington state: in the state, and roughly 6% of the people tested (nearly 33,000) have gotten back positive results. Suppose the specificity of a given test is 97%. That means that a test could come back positive for 3% of the people who don't have the virus that causes COVID-19, typically because the test is actually being triggered by a different kind of virus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In that scenario, there might be as many false positives (16,500) as there are true positives (16,500). You can see how it works , a British medical journal. Just plug in 3% for pre-test probability, 97% for test specificity, and any number above 85% for test sensitivity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That could explain how you get to a 50-50 mix of true positives and false positives. In reality, though, PCR tests tend to have , which means it's rarer that they would mistake a different sort of virus for the virus that causes COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The interplay of variables also makes a difference. If you're in a hotspot like Houston, or Yakima, right now the prevalence [of the virus] is higher, said Charissa Fotinos, who oversees the state's testing program as deputy chief medical officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority. False positives should account for less of the total in a virus hotspot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So if your coronavirus test comes back positive, should you take Musk's prescription and insist on another test? That depends, Fotinos said in a statement that includes a heaping helping of ifs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If someone who is asymptomatic and had no contacts with anyone who had symptoms, or who was known to have COVID, tests positive, you could question if that was a true positive  if there's a low number of infections in the community, she said. But if you have symptoms, or if you were told that you were in contact with someone who has COVID, you should heed that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Fotinos is more concerned about false negatives. That's because not isolating yourself if you have COVID-19 has more serious consequences for the wider community than isolating yourself if it turns out you don't have the disease. (At the same time, Fotinos acknowledged that it's a bummer for the person involved.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As more tests are conducted, public health experts want to see a decline in the proportion of positive tests. Generally we'd like that to be below 2%, or even 1%, Keith Jerome, a virologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and UW Medicine, said in an email. That means you're doing enough tests to find the people who actually have the virus, and get those people away from others so that the virus doesn't spread further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unfortunately, that's not the case for Washington state's Yakima County or other hotspots. What you're seeing now in too many parts of the country is lots of tests being run, with a much higher percentage of those tests being positive, Jerome said. In some places 10% or more of tests are positive, and that means the virus is not at all under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Fred Hutch biologist Trevor Bedford said in an email that the sheer numbers argue against false positives being the explanation for the reported rise in cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The rapid rise in percent positive of tests in Arizona, Florida and Texas strongly indicates that the rise in cases is real, Bedford wrote. In Arizona, daily tests since June 1 have a bit more than tripled from ~4000 to ~13,000, while daily confirmed cases have increased tenfold from ~300 to ~3000. There are large increases in hospitalizations as well, which won't result from increased testing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bedford has explored the dynamics of coronavirus testing in . The way he sees it, the statistics support the view that the focus of the pandemic has shifted from older to younger age ranges. Researchers also have noted that COVID-19 (though it still hits hard). That could partly explain why the number of deaths hasn't risen as steeply as the number of cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But Jerome said the jury is still out. Unfortunately, hospitalization and fatalities usually trail the first positive test by a week or two, so those measures are likely to get worse in the coming days as well, he told GeekWire.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More from GeekWire:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; King County public health officials will be distributing 20,000 coronavirus test kits&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What is effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy? UW's Kristina Adams Waldorf wants to deliver answers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tech leaders help kick off $50M fundraising campaign for UW Medicine's COVID-19 work&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Washington Gov. Inslee cuts coronavirus costs  and meets with VP Mike Pence&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Economy to recover following containment of COVID-19: Rajiv Kumar</title>
            <link>https://in.news.yahoo.com/economy-recover-following-containment-covid-142552822.html</link>
            <description> New Delhi, Jun 30 (PTI) India's economy will recover following the containment of COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing reforms would keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Tuesday.&#60;p&#62; Kumar was speaking at the virtual launch of a report titled - Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities in India's Energy and Mobility Sectors - prepared by government think tank Niti Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'India's economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic,' he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Last week, the IMF had projected a sharp contraction of 4.5 per cent for India's growth in 2020, citing unprecedented coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities, but had said the country is expected to bounce back in 2021 with a robust six per cent growth rate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers,' Kumar added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Several economists, brokerages and multilateral agencies have pointed to a deep contraction to india, triggered by the strict lockdown announced to stem the spread of deadly coronavirus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Speaking at the event, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses - the transport and power sectors - and emerge stronger,' Kant said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The report said electric vehicles market in India may experience a shift as consumers seek affordable products amid COVID-19, and it could make manufacturers resume production for conventional vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'Auto sales could decrease by as much as 45 per cent in the financial year 202021. EV production could be affected in the short term due to lower demand and supply-chain disruptions with BNEF estimating an 18 per cent decrease in global EV sales in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'The EV market may experience other shifts. For example, there is an expectation of demand for more affordable EV products. This potential shift in consumer preferences may affect manufacturers' investment and production decisions. Ultimately, resuming production levels for conventional vehicles and EVs will depend on demand revival, supply-chain reactivation, and access to the labour force,' the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lower disposable incomes and a tendency towards cash saving will lead to reduced demand for EV in the short-term, the report said, adding 'some OEMs' customers are pushing back their EV business plans by two or more years'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the impact on EV supply chains, the report said, 'There may be delays in EV production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles. Curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It also highlighted the consequences of policy changes, stating 'many state EV policies and e-bus projects may be delayed due to other priorities and social-distancing challenges'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stressing that the emerging situation and challenges in the context of COVID-19 has and will continue to disrupt business as usual in the mobility sector, the report said the impact of the pandemic on passenger and freight segments, as well as the auto industry, raise several questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; These include whether the overall demand for mobility will fall in the short to medium-term, will ridership of public and shared transport modes decline and will private modes be preferred? It also pondered whether lack of auto sales will cause a severe hit to the supply chain and a growing call for self-sufficiency lead to a push to create local supply chains.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'Will the Prime Minister's call for domestic manufacturing and localisation attract investments at a time when a recession is looming? Would the new mobility ecosystem propelled by startups be able to survive the crisis,' it wondered. PTI BKS BAL BAL&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> A new report highlights challenges and opportunities for India's transition to clean mobility and power systems in the context of COVID-19&#60;p&#62;NEW DELHI, June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report by NITI Aayog, Government of India's premier think tank, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), and RMI India discusses how COVID-19 is influencing the clean energy transition in&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, as well as identifying principles and strategic opportunities to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities for India's Energy and Mobility Sectors advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts including electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. " India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness," said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. "We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses&#195;&#162;the transport and power sectors&#195;&#162;and emerge stronger."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report lays out four principles as a framework to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives," said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. "As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For more details, please contact Ms. Ashpreet Sethi at asethi@rmi.org.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report can be accessed on the following links:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RMI: https://rmi.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RMI India: https://rmi-india.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;About RMI India&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RMI India is an independent nonprofit organization that works towards accelerating India's transition to a clean, prosperous, and inclusive energy future.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Kolkata, June 30 (PTI) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday urged NITI Aayog to form an inter-disciplinary team to initiate&#60;p&#62;preparation for a masterplan for the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site wreaked by frequent cyclones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a letter to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, she pointed out that the Sunderbans is home to 50 lakh people and has the world's largest single block of mangrove forests, which had received the worst battering 'in living memory' by Cyclone Amphan on May 20.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 'I would like to request NITI Aayog to kindly commission the preparation of a Master Plan by an inter- disciplinary team of experts covering all aspects of socio-economic development of this ecologically fragile region,' she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A central team had visited certain Amphan-ravaged villages in the Sunderbans to assess the extensive damages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Banerjee said the latest trail of devastations reminded of the need for a 'systematic review of the multiple challenge faced by the Sunderbans and calls for a scientifically designed development package for its protection and balanced socio-economic development.' Any review of the manifold challenges of Sunderbans will require a pool of experts drawn from the relevant disciplines as also technical assistance from international multilateral bodies. 'It will also require funding support from the government of India,' she said. PTI SUS KK KK&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Turning the wheels of mobility clean and green</title>
            <link>https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/clean-tech/turning-the-wheels-of-mobility-clean-and-green/article31957194.ece</link>
            <description> India, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), faces many challenges.&#60;p&#62;To achieve some of its objectives under these, and specially to fulfil its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs under the Paris Agreement), an India Roadmap on Low Carbon and Sustainable Mobility (Decarbonisation of Indian Transport Sector), was unveiled last week.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The collective effort of 45 professionals from 36 organisations, the report took some 24 months to complete, with the help of some of the best in the sector, from government, industry, voluntary organisations and logistics specialists. What they came up with is a blueprint which, if taken seriously, could help India reduce significantly the current 18 per cent of CO2 emissions from road transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report envisaged an integrated approach for best results and drew up actionable recommendations for the future, breaking them into the short term (up to 2022), medium term (2022 to 2030) and the long term (2030 to 2050).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So, what are the recommendations, the challenges to be overcome? What will it take to achieve such ambitious goals?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the short term, the report suggests that a national Transport Authority be established with Unified Metropolitan Transport Authorities for metros and a task force that would be a Citizens Charter for Urban Mobility.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This will act at a strategic, tactical and operational level, adopting an integrated approach to building modern railway stations, bus ports, air and seaports through a systems approach and encourage transit-oriented development. It also emphasises a change in the permit system and the introduction of one country one permit to incentivise inter-State shared public transport. The role of the RTO would also be redefined with automation of licensing and fitness certificates, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the medium term, the report supports setting up an integrated National Logistics Systems, with an increased use of coastline and inland waterways for passenger and freight movement. It suggests a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode for multimodal logistics solutions. For effective governance, there is emphasis on enforcing congestion charging in large metros, implementing the vehicle scrap policy and setting up scheduled services and app-based services for public transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the long term, the report favours investment in advanced technologies for electric mobility and intelligent transport systems. It envisages that, by then, 100 per cent EV stations will be powered by renewable energy through decentralised mode or through PPAs with developers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The focus will also be to ensure implementation of all advanced bio fuels as envisaged under the National Policy on Biofuels and work on alternatives for lithium-ion batteries  such as sodium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and thermal batteries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The roadmap, which was unveiled recently by Nitin Gadkari, the Union Minister for Transport and Highways, has been brought out by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &#38; Industry and supported by WWF-India, Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation. At the presentation, the minister assured stakeholders that the government will play the role of a facilitator and support the private sector in its initiatives to develop sustainable transportation systems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government believes the industry should consider sustainable transportation that comprises low-carbon fuels, electric vehicles, water transportation, conversion of diesel vehicles to LNG and CNG, use of ethanol, methanol and hydrogen fuels for vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It wants the industry to reach out to concerned State governments and ministries and suggest changes in policies to develop implementable and economically viable projects.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Patrick Oliva, Co-Founder, PPMC, the economic viability of projects is an important aspect to develop a low-carbon and sustainable transportation system. The private sector needs to invest in such ventures, with FICCI and the government playing a facilitative role.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To achieve the goals, the report highlights eight distinct components. These include an urban transformation for healthier, inclusive cities; a low-carbon energy supply strategy; optimising supply chains to manage freight transport emissions; discouraging using personal transport for commuting, shopping and accessing services; providing low-carbon solutions for rural populations. And last of all, accelerating action on adaptation in transport sector, with large-scale deployment of economic instruments and leveraging of finance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When focusing on public transportation, the India Roadmap proposes to shift the paradigm to the movement of people, rather than the movement of vehicles, as the effective means to reduce congestion, air pollution, and vehicle kilometres. This would mean transporting optimal number of people with minimum transport. For this, it suggests an integrated approach of governance and institutions, infrastructure and technology for different modes towards sustainability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dilip Chenoy, Secretary General, FICCI, believes The Roadmap is an opportunity for stakeholders in government, business, urban and transport planning to integrate low-carbon and sustainable options into their strategic decisions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As for infrastructure development, the report suggests creation of a national grid of common battery-charging infrastructure, development of bus and multi-modal terminals across the country on the lines of airports, build multi-modal logistics parks around major manufacturing and production centres with seamless rail and road connectivity to nearby ports, inland waterway terminals, and distribution centres.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It urges the government to earmark budgets for sustainable mobility for integrated transport systems and not just for specific projects such as metro, BRT or city bus projects. It suggests that a substantial part of the road project budget be allocated towards developing public transport infrastructure, such as multi-modal terminals, surface ports, bus stations, highway amenity centres and multi-modal logistics parks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Mumbai: Market gauges Sensex and Nifty gave up intra-day gains to end lower on Tuesday, dragged down by energy and financial stocks. After rising 272.39 points during the day, the BSE Sensex turned negative and settled 45.72 points, or 0.13 per cent, down at 34,915.80; while the NSE Nifty slipped 10.30 points, or 0.10 per cent, to close at 10,302.10.&#60;p&#62;In terms of quarterly performance, the Sensex gained 18.5 per cent or 5,447 points during the April-June quarter, while the Nifty rose nearly 20 per cent or 1,704 points. Meanwhile, investors remained cautious keeping in view the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy and the ongoing border standoff with China. Analysts said the Indian market pared intra-day gains as participants adopted a wait and watch approach ahead of Modi's address.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the Sensex chart, PowerGrid was the top laggard, shedding around 2 per cent, followed by Sun Pharma, ITC, ONGC, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries. On the other hand, Maruti, Nestle India, ICICI Bank and UltraTech Cement were among the gainers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sectorally, BSE oil and gas, energy, telecom, healthcare, power and utilities indices fell up to 1.51 per cent. While auto, basic materials, FMCG and bankex rose up to 1.05 per cent. Broader midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 0.75 per cent. "In spite of trading positive for most part of the day, the benchmark indices gave up its gains and ended flat with a negative bias. The markets were impacted by the uncertainties surrounding PM''s address to the nation," said Vinod Nair.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/latest-news-maharashtra-power-min-asks-mahadiscom-to-set-up-helpdesk-for-grievance-redressal-1858087.html</link>
            <description> Mumbai, Jun 30 (PTI) Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut has asked state-owned Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk to address consumers' grievances&#60;p&#62;after state electricity regulator MERC supported the utilities saying the bills charged by the discoms were as per the rules.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Following the consumers' complaints over inflated bills in June, MERC had sought clarification from the discoms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also Read | GST Day 2020: History and Significance of The Day That Commemorates Introduction of 'One Nation, One Tax' Regime in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), later observed that the discoms had followed the rules of "practise direction".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The present bills raised on actual meter readings are of the summer months where the consumption is normally high and the bills are always of higher amounts. Hence the balance amount payable after adjusting the average bill amounts for each of the three months March, April and May have led to higher bill that was issued in June," it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also Read | National Chartered Accountant Day 2020: Know Date, History And Significance of The Day Celebrated to Honour CAs Across The Nation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; MERC has also asked the utilities to provide the option of easy monthly instalments (EMI) and directed them to not disconnect power supply over non-payment of dues until grievances are redressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Raut directed Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk at divisional levels and also take initiatives to spread awareness among customers about the billing process by reaching out through various platforms like TV, radio, webinar and Facebook, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The state discom has decided to allow EMI option for three months for making the payment of the bill for June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Raut also asked the discom to grant a discount of two per cent to consumers who have promptly paid the bills for June as well as for those who would be paying the bill amount in lump sum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also, those who had left for their villages during the lockdown period but have paid the bills for the three months on estimated basis, would get a refund in case they have paid extra amount.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Many consumers, including celebrities like Taapsee Pannu, Huma Qureshi, director Bijoy Nambiar and Renuka Shahane, took to Twitter to express concerns over the unexpected rise in their electricity bills during the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to MERC, all these utilities have dropped tariffs after the commission's revision order from April 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, since the country went into lockdown from March 25, following the COVID outbreak, the bills were calculated as per the previous readings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Adani Electricity reduced 12 per cent power tariff for all categories, followed by Tata Power (10 per cent), Mahadiscom (five per cent) and BEST (one per cent).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to MERC, only 6.35 lakh consumers across state were billed on actual meter readings during the lockdown, which is nearly 2.32 per cent of the total consumer base in the state.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, MERC has already approved installation of 7 lakh meters for Adani and 66,000 meters for Tata Power, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tags:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Auto component sector may see 16% dip in revenue</title>
            <link>https://telanganatoday.com/auto-component-sector-may-see-16-dip-in-revenue</link>
            <description> This will add to the pain from an estimated de-growth of 10 per cent in the industry's revenue to Rs 3.2 lakh crore last fiscal, Crisil Ratings said in its report on Tuesday&#60;p&#62;Mumbai : Supply chain disruptions in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak coupled with weak demand for vehicles in India and overseas is likely to squeeze the revenue of the automotive component sector by 16 per cent this fiscal, says a report. This will add to the pain from an estimated de-growth of 10 per cent in the industrys revenue to Rs 3.2 lakh crore last fiscal, Crisil Ratings said in its report on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The growth projections are based on an analysis of 300 Crisil-rated auto component suppliers that account for 40 per cent of the sectors revenue, it said. The automotive component sector is expected to log around 16 per cent de-growth in revenue this fiscal as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupts the supply chain and impairs underlying vehicle demand in both domestic and overseas markets, Crisil Ratings said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the report, the domestic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which account for over two-thirds of the sectors revenue, are staring at a decadal low vehicle sales volume at 169 lakh units this fiscal with the production schedule of the manufacturers likely to remain modest in the first two quarters of the fiscal followed by a gradual recovery, Crisil Ratings said. Additionally, demand growth from exports and the aftermarket, which together account for around one-third of demand, will also remain in the red this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Muted demand sentiment in major export destinations will dent exports, while lower vehicle usage and closure of automotive servicing workshops during the lockdown will affect aftermarket demand, the report stated. Possibly for the first time in over a decade, we are seeing demand from OEMs, exports and the aftermarket in the red this fiscal, in addition to demand slowdown for two consecutive years, said Anuj Sethi of Crisil Ratings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Despite cost rationalisation measures and the highly flexible nature of cost structures, with 80 per cent of costs being variable in nature, operating profitability will take a hit of up to 250 basis points for the rated portfolio, while the impact on absolute operating profit will be almost 30-35 per cent, he added. The only silver lining is the sectors prudent financial practices with respect to capital spending over the past few years, leading to well managed balance sheets, said Sameer Charania, Director, Crisil Ratings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The average gearing for Crisils sample set remains adequate at less than one-time and is expected to remain under control due to only need-based capital spending and a modest stretch in working capital, he said. Firms with component concentration to commercial vehicles and those which have undertaken large debt-funded expansion in recent times will be more vulnerable than more-diversified ones, the report stated. While the RBIs moratorium on debt obligations for firms and steps initiated to provide funding to MSMEs (including smaller tier II and tier III suppliers) may help overcome temporary cash-flow mismatches, recovery in demand, which is expected in the next fiscal, is critical for sustained and improvement in the sectors financial health, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New Delhi : Electric vehicles market in India may experience a shift as consumers seek affordable products amid Covid-19, and it could make manufacturers resume production for conventional vehicles, according to a report. The report  Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities in Indias Energy and Mobility Sectors  is prepared by government think tank Niti Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Auto sales could decrease by as much as 45 per cent in the financial year 202021. EV production could be affected in the short term due to lower demand and supply-chain disruptions with BNEF estimating an 18 per cent decrease in global EV sales in 2020. The EV market may experience other shifts. For example, there is an expectation of demand for more affordable EV products. This potential shift in consumer preferences may affect manufacturers investment and production decisions. Ultimately, resuming production levels for conventional vehicles and EVs will depend on demand revival, supply-chain reactivation, and access to the labour force, the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lower disposable incomes and a tendency towards cash saving will lead to reduced demand for EV in the short term, the report said, adding some OEMs customers are pushing back their EV business plans by two or more years. On the impact on EV supply chains, the report said, There may be delays in EV production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles. Curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report also highlighted the consequences of policy changes stating many state EV policies and e-bus projects may be delayed due to other priorities and social-distancing challenges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on Telegram everyday.

            <title>NTPC, IOC plan waste-energy plant at Okhla to keep SDMC area clean</title>
            <link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ntpc-ioc-plan-waste-energy-plant-at-okhla-to-keep-sdmc-area-clean/articleshow/76718211.cms</link>
            <description> NEW DELHI: State-run generation utility NTPC, oil refiner-fuel retailer IndianOil and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday signed an MoU for building a waste-to-energy plant at the Okhla landfill site in the national capital.&#60;p&#62;SDMC will provide an acre of land for the plant, which will use plasma technology for producing syngas (synthesised gas) by processing different kinds of waste -- industrial, biomedical and hazardous. This gas will be used to generate power. NTPC and IOC will fund the project equally.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The demonstration plant will convert 50 tonnes per day of refuse-derived fuel, obtained by segregating combustible components in waste, to syngas. The residue will be converted into vitrified slag, which can be used for building roads and in construction or manufacturing sanitaryware and decorative tiles. The plant will be designed as a zero liquid discharge unit. SDMC area generates about 1,750 tonne of waste, 50% of which is processed at present.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;NTPC is also collaborating with East Delhi Municipal Corporation and civic bodies at Kawas in Gujarat, Varanasi in UP, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Mohali in Punjab for building plants to produce energy from municipal waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said offtake guarantee for compressed biogas production plants is available under his ministrys SATAT scheme and generation of gas from waste will help in reducing imports of petroleum products and save foreign exchange.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said the proposed plant is an example of two ministries coming together for a good public cause just the way the prime minister talks about breaking silos. His ministry has decided to support such plants, irrespective of the cost of the gas produced by them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> A central team had visited certain Amphan-ravaged villages in the Sunderbans to assess the extensive damages.&#60;p&#62;West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday urged NITI Aayog to form an inter-disciplinary team to initiate preparation for a masterplan for the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site wreaked by frequent cyclones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a letter to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, she pointed out that the Sunderbans is home to 50 lakh people and has the worlds largest single block of mangrove forests, which had received the worst battering in living memory by Cyclone Amphan on May 20.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I would like to request NITI Aayog to kindly commission the preparation of a Master Plan by an inter-disciplinary team of experts covering all aspects of socio-economic development of this ecologically fragile region, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A central team had visited certain Amphan-ravaged villages in the Sunderbans to assess the extensive damages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Banerjee said the latest trail of devastations reminded of the need for a systematic review of the multiple challenge faced by the Sunderbans and calls for a scientifically designed development package for its protection and balanced socio-economic development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any review of the manifold challenges of Sunderbans will require a pool of experts drawn from the relevant disciplines as also technical assistance from international multilateral bodies. It will also require funding support from the government of India, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;? The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            <link>http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2020/07/south-south-cooperation-in-green-energy.html</link>
            <description> Partnership with US critical in translating Indias bold vision for development into reality: Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu&#60;p&#62;The discussion on US-India partnership was hosted by Hudson Institutes director of India Initiative, Aparna Pande, who referred to the Indo-US ties as one between natural allies. She asked a series of questions on the three pegs that comprise the partnership: economic, strategic and people to people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Citing the bilateral trade figure of USD 150 billion, the Indian envoy spoke about how all major US Fortune 500 companies are among the 2,000 American companies that have invested in India. At the same time, Indian companies, numbering over 200, have invested more than USD 22 billion in the US economy. The Indian companies have created more than 1,25,000 jobs in America, he noted.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, the strong defence partnership is shown not just by the USD 21 billion in trade but the two countries also support a free and open Indo-Pacific based on a rules-based order, based on ASEAN centrality, with freedom of navigation and peaceful settlement of disputes under the framework of international law, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted this partnership, Sandhu said. Not only are Indian-American and Indian-origin doctors and healthcare professionals at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic but there are three ongoing partnerships in COVID-19 vaccine development between companies and institutions of the two countries, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Gilead Sciences has entered into an agreement with seven Indian companies to manufacture and distribute Remdesivir, which has been authorised for emergency use against COVID-19, to several other countries in the world, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sandhu also emphasised the critical role played by the four million-strong Indian-American community along with over 200,000 Indian students and other professionals who work in the United States.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Things were tough in early June, now there is stability, says Manish Sisodia</title>
            <link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/things-were-tough-in-early-june-now-there-is-stability-says-manish-sisodia/story-3Gm0v8B0hhrfu0HpCvKyMM.html</link>
            <description> New Delhi Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds temporary charge of the state health ministry, spoke to HT about&#60;p&#62;where Delhi stands in the Covid-19 fight, working with the Centre on formulating strategies, ramping up testing, the positivity rate, community transmission, home isolation, and the state's finances, among other issues. Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Do you think Delhi has already seen its Covid-19 peak, or is it yet to come?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, we are in a comfortable situation. If you ask me about the peak, the time between June 8 and June 15, or rather the first two weeks of June, were a bit hard. We have seen stability after that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, when we were testing 5,000-6,000 people, about 2,000 were testing positive. Now, we are doing anywhere between 17,000 and 22,000 tests, and 3,000 are testing positive. This means there is stability in the number of cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If we look at the number of beds, the peak need was 6,200 beds. Now, it is close to 5,800-5,900this shows that there is stability in the number of beds needed. Deaths are also under control; not a huge spike.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Considering the character of this virus and what we are seeing across the globe, it will be wrong if I conclude that we will no longer see those jerks or spikes again. This phase, which I am calling a stable one, might be temporary phase, which is why surveillance and surveys, which are currently happening in the city, are very important.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Home minister Amit Shah has said your projection of 550,000 cases in Delhi by the end of July created some panic among people. Your comment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What I said back then was the ground reality of the time. Now, whether the decision to share the projection of Covid cases with the public was right or wrong is very subjective. My viewpoint is that by throwing the numbers out in the open, a sense of urgency came in all of us, including the Centre. It is because of that alert that all stakeholders, including the central government, our government, NGOs and municipal corporations, came together. I feel sharing data with the public always proves to be beneficial.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How did the government arrive at these numbers?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; These projections were made based on a formula given by the government of India (GoI), which has created a portal for this, and that is what we're following. The projection of the total number of cases at present is not very different from the projection of 1 lakh cases by June-end that we had made back then. But other numbers are very different now. For example, we had then projected that active cases would be around 60,000 by now, but at present, we have only around 26,000 active cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Are there any fresh projections?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No, today also we are doing all arrangements based on the same assessment made in the beginning of June. Our target was to prepare 15,000 beds. We have that today. We also have more than enough beds in quarantine centres. There are more than 8,500 quarantine beds ready, and only over 1,700 of them are currently occupied.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We were expecting that over 15,000 beds would be required, but now only around 5,900 beds are being utilised. In between, bed occupancy had peaked at 6,200 but things have improved since then.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At present, there are some signs of stability with the recovery rate improving and the positivity rate declining. This stability gives us hope, but we cannot be under the illusion that no more preparation is required.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The good thing is that Delhi's recovery rate is very promising. Today's recovery rate is 63.3%. This has helped us build confidence among the people in the chief minister's five weapons to fight Corona. Testing is being scaled up, and based on that, symptomatic cases are being isolated. More beds than what is required are being set up. The fourth is plasma therapy, which has shown positive results in Delhi. And the last one is survey and screening.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, we have about 744 ventilator beds, and only 160 are vacant. Does that worry you?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I agree that ventilators are the need of the hour, which is why I just took a meeting to review this matter, and we are working to augment it further. The central government has also helped us in this, but we are also procuring machines on our own. Every major Delhi government hospital has also been asked to chalk out a plan on how their capacity can be increased further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The government's data shows that a lot of the stability started coming about two weeks ago  around the time the Centre stepped in. Would the Covid situation have been different in Delhi had the Union government not intervened?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I stand by what the chief minister said yesterday  credit sara unka, zaroorat saari humari (credit all theirs, need all ours).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One good thing is that with the Centre's help, we have got some staff now in our dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We have got staff from ITBP who are manning the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and hospital. At present, they have given staff for 1,000 beds, but I hope they will provide more personnel for all the 10,000 beds when they are utilised. Besides, we have got some oxygen cylinders, ventilators and rail coaches from the Centre.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But this pandemic is so unprecedented that if any government or stakeholder claims that the situation was stabilised solely because of them, it would be too much. The good thing today is that all three  the Central government, the Delhi government and civil society  are working together in good coordination with each other. This is not the time to do post-mortems on who failed or passed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Difference of opinion is always there, and it is natural. There were some decisions taken by them (Central government and the Lieutenant-Governor), which we opposed in our discussions with them. We even kept our view in the public forum, sought views, and they withdrew those decisions. But, these things keep happening. It is a part of the process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How are you handling the manpower shortage?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, in our hospitals, we are bypassing all government processes to appoint medical staff on an immediate basis. All our medical directors have been authorised or empowered to create posts and fill them. We have decentralised the system, which has helped a lot. The municipal corporations are doing their bit in conducting surveys.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Is there any confusion around the house-to-house surveys to be conducted across Delhi that led the Union government extending the July 6 deadline?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, MHA has not given us any standard operating procedure (SOP) on how this is to be done. This was recommended by the Centre's expert committee headed by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog. Once we get the SOP, then we will discuss it with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Delhi government got its way on home isolation for mild and asymptomatic patients. Earlier, the government outsourced the follow-up process to a private firm. How is it being done now?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have issued a tender to rope in a private firm so that the follow-up process of home isolation patients is outsourced like before. In the meantime, we are trying to cope with whatever resources we have. We have put our staff from mohalla clinics and teams of district surveillance officers on the job as of now. But this is not sufficient.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are again going to outsource the tele-counselling task to a private firm. Which company gets the job will be known once the tender process is over. It will be finalised in a day or two.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Centre asked the Delhi government to analyse the deaths. What have we found out?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; They (Centre) have asked for the data; we provided it. Now, pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators are also available; this has made home isolation a great solution. So far, more than 52,000 people have recovered.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the beginning of June, there were some issues  there were times when it took two-three hours for the admission of patients; now it takes a maximum of 10 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Centre said in the past that deaths happening in first one to three days of hospital admission implied that home isolation protocols were not being followed strictly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If a person is eligible for home isolation as per ICMR protocols  we have not set up our own protocols  it is much better if they stay at home rather than going to the Covid centres.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If someone needs hospitalisation, there is zero compromise on our end and from our medical teams. After reaching the hospitals, yes, there were some issues at the beginning. Now, the app is working really well and all the problems have been rectified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Is there community transmission in Delhi or not, and does that impact the response in any way?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I feel that a lot of things will become clear after the sero surveillance study is done.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, 20% of the cases were reported from containment areas, 40% from clusters, and almost 40% were isolated cases. Now the clusters have also been included in the containment zones. That's why the increase in the number of zones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Actually, when you confirm community transmission, then rather than contact tracing, you focus on facilitating medical care. We are already doing that. But, yes, the resource and manpower that is focused on containment and tracing will no longer be a worry if you accept community transmission.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, we need to understand that Delhi is not a small city. In the same city, there could be a colony where community transmission could be ongoing but another colony in the same city might be very less affected. You cannot have the same yardstick for both. In a city like Delhi, you will still have to have multiple strategies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What about the rapid antigen test?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Every day, we are doing up to 20,000 tests. The main benefit is that we have been able to scale up testing. There is a limit to RT-PCR testing. That is why we are purchasing 5 lakh more tests so that we can increase it more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The positivity rate of RT-PCR was higher as it was restricted to certain people; the positivity rate among the entire population of the containment areas also comes up to about 7% according to current data. Would these people have been missed had we not started rapid testing?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the benefit of rapid testing -- you can do it at a large scale. You cannot scale up RT-PCR to that level.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are moving towards 40,000 tests a day. And, the day we do that, it is possible that 4,000 people will test positive, I am prepared for that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Now that the Capital has been unlocked, are the state finances looking up?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No. Our collection for the first quarter of last year was 7,275 crore. This year it is approximately 2,500 crore only. So, our collection has been just one-third compared to last year. And, this is only GST and VAT. Excise, registry, and car sales have also stopped  that data has not been included in this. Total revenue in these categories must be only about 10% of the usual revenue.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since there is so much cooperation going on, and the Union home minister is also doing such handholding, I hope he will help us in this regard as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for 5,000 crore, but we are yet to hear from her. If we get this money  and I hope the Centre will give it  along with the GST compensation, then we can manage easily.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Schools are closed till July 31. What is the plan after this?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let us see. It is very difficult for me to say what the situation will be in July or August. The Government of India also said yesterday that schools will remain closed. We had assessed this a few days ago and announced our decision. It will take time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Enter your email to get our daily newsletter in your inbox&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Despite ban, illegal extraction continues in River Tawi</title>
            <link>http://www.earlytimes.in/newsdet.aspx?q=294270</link>
            <description> Early Times Report&#60;p&#62;Jammu, June 30: As the night descends over Jammu outskirts, earth movers and dumpers start their activities of extracting minerals from river Tawi which is otherwise banned as per the directions of law governing bodies in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The locals of many areas along the banks of river Tawi informed that during night hours, dozens of earth movers and dumpers could be found making their way into the river and started extraction of minor minerals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dozens of dumpers laden with minor minerals including sand, bajri, could be found transporting the minor minerals from river Tawi to various areas of the Jammu city that too under the watch of law enforcement staff manning the roads during night hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Though as per laid guidelines the extraction of minor minerals from majority of the rivulets and rivers is banned in entire Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory but extraction is going on unabated illegally, the villagers said, adding that some of the influential politicians from the area have been involved in the entire process of illegal extraction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sources in the department informed that the extraction is banned in majority of the rivers and rivulets as per the directions of National Green Tribunal and Supreme Court. But extraction of minerals has been going on given the nexus of some law enforcement agencies. Usually the department of Mining has limited strength of employees, which is insufficient to check the illegal extraction of minerals. During the daytime they could be available but during the night hours they are mostly not able to venture into the field, due to which the illegal extraction of minerals usually happens, an official said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The official further said that it was beyond doubt that extraction was banned in river Tawi due to which the illegal extraction was done during the night hours. It is possible only with the active connivance of some locals as well as employees of some law enforcement departments that extraction of minerals has been done, sources said, adding that it amounted to big loss to the state exchequer as well as to the common public.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Director Geology and Mining Department Vikas Sharma said that earlier also the department had sent teams to take action against the illegal mining activities. Even the team had to face violent resistance after which an FIR was also registered. He further said that as per the Court directions the police have been entrusted to check the illegal mining during night hours but assured that he would look into the matter and take appropriate action.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Mexican president orders fraud complaints against green power firms</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/mexico-corruption/mexican-president-orders-fraud-complaints-against-green-power-firms-idINL1N2E71T7</link>
            <description> MEXICO CITY, June 30 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ordered on Tuesday that formal complaints be drawn up alleging fraud by mostly renewable power companies, but he gave no evidence backing up the complaints.&#60;p&#62; Ramping up his repeated allegations of corruption in power generation contracts won by mostly wind and solar power companies, Lopez Obrador said that while he remains open to dialogue with the companies, he also wants his aides to prepare the legal complaints against them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We want to talk to the companies one by one. At the same time, I've given the order to begin drawing up formal complaints, Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lopez Obrador, who has moved on several fronts to centralize more control over energy in state hands, alleged that after the private power firms won supply contracts at auction with state-run electricity company CFE that additional deals were inked that gave them preferential rates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He provided no evidence to support the allegation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since April, the government has sought to prevent more than 40 wind and solar power plants from connecting to the CFE-owned grid, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic requires an uninterrupted power supply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Critics have alleged that Lopez Obrador instead seeks to favor the CFE's mostly fossil fuel-derived power generation, and that he is generally suspicious of any private-sector participation in energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Julio Valle, spokesman for Mexico's wind power association AMDEE, countered that the president mostly seeks to distract public opinion with the allegations. The (clean energy) auctions were subject to numerous legal safeguards and were transparent, and they've attracted significant investment to Mexico, said Valle.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The dispute directly affects more than $6 billion in partially or already built wind and solar power plants, which judges have allowed to proceed as planned despite the government push to stop them.

            <title>L&#38;T completes cryostat for global fusion project</title>
            <link>http://www.bihartimes.in/Newsbihar/2020/June/newsbihar30June13.html</link>
            <description> Hazira (Gujarat), June 30: The heavy engineering arm of Larsen and Toubro, has completed the final assembly of cryostat, the largest stainless steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;p&#62;It's an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion sector as well as a moment of pride for the'Make in India' initiative, said L&#38;T, India's leading engineering, construction, technology, manufacturing and financial services conglomerate, in a statement, here on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ceremony was attended through video link by International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Global's Director-General Bernard Bigot, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman K.N. Vyas, ITER-India Project Director U.K. Baruah, NITI Aayog Member V.K. Saraswat, L&#38;T Group Chairman A.M. Naik, CEO &#38; MD of L&#38;T S.N. Subrahmanyan and others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Today, in Hazira, we celebrate the completion of fabrication of all segments, including the Top Lid, of the cryostat. We achieved it under these challenging conditions," said Bigot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Subrahmanyan said it was a proud moment for L&#38;T as it had achieved another milestone in the development of world's largest stainless steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high quality, high-precision assemblies to the ITER, he said and added, it would pave the way for installation of cryostat at the project site in France and "lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"It has empowered India to move towards Atmanirbhar Bharat plan by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology," the L&#38;T CEO said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly referred as the Top Lid, weighing 650 tonnes, is to be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER at a reactor pit in southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat, which provides cooling to the fusion reactor and keeps very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering was divided into three aspects. First, the company was to manufacture assemblies at its Hazira complex. The second aspect involved building a temporary workshop at the project site in Cadarache, France, for the assembly of various sectors. And finally, to integrate the cryostat with the Tokamak Reactor building.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With the flagging off, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has completed the manufacturing work planned in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.industrialautomationindia.in/interviewsitm/10049/Predictive-maintenance-support-is-a-significant-step-to-be-more-customer-centric/interviews</link>
            <description> Rajesh Premchandran, Director  ISAAME, India, South Asia, Africa and Middle-East, Elgi Equipments Limited.&#60;p&#62;At ELGi, our definition of Always Better is closely coupled with us always being the customers choice. And our 400+ product range bears testament to this; for example, the lubricated screw [ELGi Global (EG) series and Encapsulated (EN) Series] and oil free screw air compressors are highly reliable, energy efficient and operate at low energy costs. Our Oil free (OF) series and Always Better (AB) series of oil free screw compressors are class zero certified by TUV in accordance with the ISO 8573 standards and the (HRS) heat recovery systems help companies recover approximately 96% of the waste heat generated during the compression process which can then be re-utilised for heating of air and water.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Weve also innovated to address the compressed air needs of companies who have historically suffered the constraints of high cost, poor reliability, and low efficiency in order to have oil free air. The ELGi AB Always Better series, a disruption in oil free compressed air technology, offers every customer across the globe, a no-compromise, oil free solution at approximately 8  10% reduced lifecycle cost when compared with prevailing oil free technology. Finally, our compressed air experts across the world offer specialised services to help customers identify potential areas of energy savings and provide them with solutions guaranteeing the optimum use of compressed air.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Compressed air consumption is a measure of a plants automation level, it is said. Your comment?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The use of compressed air in the automation industry offers the following benefits compared to use of other systems for the same application:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;1. The systems are easier and simpler to use. Pneumatically operated tools and nozzles are more compact and have lesser maintenance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;2. Air can be used in multiple environments without the risk of catching fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;3. Air can be easily transported to multiple locations with the use of compressed air piping.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This has resulted in extensive use of compressed air systems in the automation industry. But a poorly designed system without a good understanding of the air needs can result in wasted energy and higher costs of operation. The challenges that customers face is normally an inability to foresee in advance increase and decrease in demand due to varying production needs on the shop floor. This can result in increased electricity costs. Of all the energy used in manufacturing, compressed air systems have potential for improvement. World over, compressed air systems consume energy and also result in wasted energy costs due to preventable maintenance issues and inefficient operations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Right sizing is sufficient for those customers with stable air demand. Customers who have varying demand patterns during the day or those customers who anticipate an increase in manufacturing capacity during seasons can save up to 28% with Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). A VFD works by reducing the compressor motors speed to lower flow to match the actual air demand of the customer and there by consume lower power when compared to a fixed speed machine which would unload in the same conditions, thereby significantly reducing unload energy consumption. Furthermore Heat Recovery Systems (HRS) help companies to recover approximately 96% of the waste heat generated during the compression process which can then be utilised for heating air (space) or water. This in turn eliminates additional equipment requirements to heat water or air, thereby eliminating the CO2 emissions to a large extent. They are best suited for customers across process industries spanning paper, sugar, food and beverages, dairy, textiles, etc., mainly companies who require compressed air and use hot water for their process requirements.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Compressors can be energy guzzlers if not used properly. What are the measures manufacturers take to educate the customer and optimise the utility?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The first thing that we do is understand our customers compressed air needs. For example, for an application like spray painting using pneumatic guns, the compressed air directly mixes with the paint. In this case, based on the flow, pressure and the quality of compressed air required, we suggest the right compressor and the ideal downstream accessories required for this application. The illustration shows the benefits that a customer get out of a right sized compressor. To avoid pressure drops between the compressed air generation and the utility points, we recommend the right sized compressor, pressure, and positioning of the compressor in the given layout to have the desired air pressure at the application points. We also advise customers to build an effective compressed air distribution system and employ energy saving air audit programs and implementation of compressed air monitoring processes to run an efficient compressed air system in their facilities. Regular training to the customers on compressor maintenance and importance of periodic change and use of genuine parts and consumables help them to gain efficiency and significantly reduce maintenance costs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is not just products, but solutions that customers expect today. What are the services you offer for this?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As discussed earlier, our compressed air experts across the world offer specialised services to help customers identify potential areas of energy savings and provide them with solutions guaranteeing the optimum use of compressed air. We engage with customers through structured air audit programs that enable us to study the customers application pattern and recommend solutions that can significantly save energy. Our air audit programs have helped customers identify energy saving opportunities resulting in the savings of over $9 million. Also, ELGis predictive maintenance support is a significant step in our efforts to be more customer-centric and data-driven as we seek to provide the most efficient compressed air solutions. Gathering data is easy, but analysing the data and providing meaningful insights to customers is what constitutes the future. For example, the ELGi team collated data for a piping company and the resulting recommendations contributed to over 40% energy savings. In the case of a textile company, our IoT system recorded an abnormal pressure reading that helped us identify a choked air-filter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Compressed air as a service is a model followed by some manufacturers and service providers. How does this work in practice?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Compressed air as a service or rental compressor business is at a nascent stage in India. The small and medium scale industries require piston and screw air compressors for short term compressed air needs. Owing to limitations in installation, piston compressors taken for rent ranges only up to 15 hp. For air requirements ranging from 15 to 100 hp, screw compressors are preferred for rental service. Portable compressors are the preferred choice for rental when it comes to huge construction, infrastructure, oil &#38; gas and drilling projects. Compressed air rental business has so far witnessed marginal growth in the tier 1 and tier 2 cities across India and the future growth of this business will be purely based on the growth of small, medium scale industries and the large scale construction and infra projects across the nation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Conquer K-2 (CK2)  our aspiration to be the No. 2 in the Global Air Compressor Market by 2027, draws inspiration from Mount K2, the second highest peak in the world and arguably, the toughest peak to ascend among the eight thousanders. To accomplish our aspirational targets, our market facing dimension of strategy (Where to Play?), includes, in addition to organic growth, business acquisitions across the world with specific focus on India, Europe, USA, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. On the value proposition dimension of strategy (how to win?), we are focusing on innovation centred around energy efficiency and oil-free and quality to be the best in the world. We believe that delivering strongly and reliably on these value propositions, will set us apart from competitors and build our business globally. Today, we do business in more than 120 countries with direct presence in 28 countries. We have our own manufacturing facilities in India, Italy and the USA with subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, UAE and Indonesia. At this moment, more than 2 million ELGi air compressors are driving critical applications across various industries verticals, supported by a strongly knit sales and service network of 2000+ people and 200+ distributors, worldwide.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any comments on the Covid-19 crisis and the impact on the global business as a whole?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Well, the pandemic has certainly disrupted global supply chains and international trade. We are anticipating challenges in demand, supply, employee safety and general business continuity. Our teams are engaged with predicting and planning for the consequences of Covid-19. As we gain more comfort around this new normal, we will refocus our attention on our strategic markets and initiatives towards CK2, our ambition to be second largest compressed air manufacturer in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajesh Premchandran is Director  India, South Asia, Africa and Middle-East, Elgi Equipments Limited, and an experienced senior leadership professional with a demonstrated track record of growing business in the mechanical, HVAC and mechanical engineering industry.

            <title>Indian private firms seen developing 15 million tonnes capacity coal mines this year - minister</title>
            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/indian-private-firms-seen-developing-183919611.html</link>
            <description> MoreBy Sudarshan Varadhan&#60;p&#62;CHENNAI (Reuters) - India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India .&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency Moody's Indian unit ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9% between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7% this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Giles Elgood)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>India records quarterly current account surplus for first time in 13 years</title>
            <link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-records-quarterly-current-account-surplus-for-first-time-in-13-years/articleshow/76718052.cms</link>
            <description> MUMBAI: India's current account turned positive in the last quarter of the 2019/20 fiscal year as a result of a lower trade deficit and a sharp rise in net invisible receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said on Tuesday, the first quarterly surplus in 13 years.&#60;p&#62;The current account recorded a surplus of $600 million or 0.1% of Indian gross domestic product in the three months to March 2020 compared to a deficit of 0.7% in the same period a year ago, RBI data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This represents the first time that India's quarterly current account, which measures the difference between the value of a country's imported and exported goods and services, has recorded a surplus since the January-March quarter of 2007.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The RBI data also showed the current account deficit (CAD) for the October-December quarter of 2019/20 was revised to $2.6 billion or 0.4% of GDP from $1.4 billion earlier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"On paper this looks healthy but it primarily reflects India's economic slowdown, which has significantly reduced the non oil, non precious metals imports during FY20," Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&#38;T Financial Holdings, said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the year as a whole the CAD narrowed to 0.9% of GDP versus 2.1% in 2018/19, the data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Net services receipts increased on the back of a rise in net earnings from computer, travel and financial services," the RBI said in a release.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, increased to $20.6 billion, up by 9.0% from their level a year ago," it added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly to $35 billion from $35.2 billion a year ago, RBI said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Balance of payments stood at a surplus of $18.8 billion in Q4 of 2019/20, compared with a surplus of $14.2 billion a year ago, the RBI data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There was an accretion of $59.5 billion to foreign exchange reserves in 2019/20, the RBI said. Forex reserves recently climbed to a record $507.6 billion before falling slightly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Our forecast for a modest deficit could easily swing to a surplus if differential of global versus domestic economic activity widens, lending to slower recovery in core imports," Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T-made Major Cryostat Base Installed in Worlds Largest Nuclear Fusion Project in France</title>
            <link>https://kolkatatoday.com/business/lt-made-major-cryostat-base-installed-in-worlds-largest-nuclear-fusion-project-in-france/</link>
            <description> L&#38;T Heavy Engineering  manufactured 1250 MT-Cryostat base, the single largest section of the Worlds Largest Nuclear Fusion Reactor, was successfully lifted and placed into a Reactor building in France recently, accomplishing a major milestone in the nuclear engineering world.&#60;p&#62;It will be noteworthy to mention that assembly tools of Cryostat were delivered during the lockdown by the Heavy Engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro to ensure the uninterrupted assembly of Cryostat in Reactor pit in southern France. The cryostat forms the vacuum-tight container surrounding the reactor vacuum vessel and the superconducting magnets and acts essentially as a very large refrigerator.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The reactor base, the single largest and heaviest Tokamak component of the worlds largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum, pressure chamber Cryostat, will eventually contain the rest of the reactor.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On this occasion, Dr Bernard Bigot, Director-General, ITER organization said, We thank L&#38;T for the timely deliveries, in the current difficult circumstances, of the Cryostat base alignment tool &#38; shims which are critical to install cryostat base, as brilliantly manufactured by L&#38;T since 2015. This installation into the ITER Tokamak building is a significant activity for other downstream activities to achieve the mission for a First Plasma as soon as possible by the end of 2025. This could have been possible, amidst COVID-19 lockdown period, only due to the extraordinary dedicated efforts of L&#38;T team and invaluable support of the Indian government authorities. L&#38;T has always been a trusted partner in meeting the goals of ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T has also already delivered the Lower Cylinder of the Cryostat in March 2019 and Upper Cylinder in Mar 2020. The final part, the Top Lid Sectors will be dispatched from Hazira in July 2020. The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering is divided into three parts, firstly manufacturing and shipping of all subassembly sections from L&#38;T Hazira, Gujarat, then constructing a temporary workshop at the project site in France for assembling the cryostat sections into large assemblies and lastly to integrate the cryostat inside the Tokamak Reactor building.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on the momentous achievement, Mr Anil V Parab, Executive Vice President and Head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering said ITER is a first of its kind futuristic global project. The cryostat is the largest vacuum vessel ever built with 29.4 meters in diameter, 29 meters in height weighing 3,850 MT. Successful delivery of such complex projects is ingrained in L&#38;Ts culture.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We are proud of L&#38;T Heavy Engineerings Nuclear Team, which is showcasing Indian capabilities, in high technology area at a global stage with pride. This is a testimony of the strong pedigree and world-class manufacturing capabilities of L&#38;T.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts Heavy Engineering business won the prestigious contract in 2012. ITER India, a wing of Department of Atomic Energy, is the overall in-charge of the Indian participation for this ambitious mega scientific project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is among the seven elite countries funding the $20 bn International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program in Cadarache, France. This is one of the worlds largest research project that seeks to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has state-of-the-art, fully integrated, world-class manufacturing facilities at Hazira (Surat), Powai (Mumbai) and Vadodara. The Heavy engineering business of L&#38;T has a proven track record of supplying technology-intensive equipment and systems to global customers in Refinery, Oil &#38; Gas, Petrochemicals, Fertilizers and Nuclear Power industries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(By Pratyusha Mukherjee)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Demand for Doble's Transient Cyber Asset Program Rises</title>
            <link>http://www.itnewsonline.com/prnewswire/Demand-for-Dobles-Transient-Cyber-Asset-Program-Rises/698543</link>
            <description> Doble experiences strong growth of its transient cyber asset security services as top electric utilities turn to the company to meet and exceed stringent NERC CIP regulatory requirements&#60;p&#62;MARLBOROUGH, Mass., June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Doble Engineering Company, a leader in power grid diagnostic solutions and subsidiary of ESCO Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ESE), today announced it has seen sustained growth in its Transient Cyber Asset (TCA) program. During the first half of 2020, the company achieved a record client renewal rate and strong customer acquisition growth, especially among the Fortune 500 and top electric utilities in the U.S.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Doble's Transient Cyber Asset program is a comprehensive Managed Security Services (MSS) solution that supports electric utility field crews. As part of the offering, customers can choose from a range of rugged, special-purpose laptops or tablets, called Doble Universal Controllers (DUCs), or use their own transient devices. Doble's expert team hardens the devices to minimize cybersecurity risks and optimizes them for efficient field work. Doble's solution also includes remote management, 24/7 customer support, and compliance monitoring to ensure the devices remain secure and compliant to applicable regulations over their operational lifetime.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Doble's Transient Cyber Asset program is growing due to the continuing evolution of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) critical infrastructure protection (CIP) cybersecurity standards. NERC CIP-003-8, which went into effect in&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;January 2020, expanded transient cyber asset requirements to low impact substations, bringing many more power plants and utilities within scope of the security mandates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Transient cyber asset security is a significant security and regulatory issue facing the power industry today. Any laptop or tablet used in a bulk electric system substation must now meet NERC's CIP standards," said Bryan Sayler, president of Doble Engineering Company. "Our program is designed to support utilities of all sizes, working in any application, whether transmission, distribution, conventional generation, or renewable power. Our managed program provides customers and regulators confidence in the security of their critical assets and the ability to meet the new standards.

            <title>New Citroen C4, e-C4 Details Out; Being Considered For India</title>
            <link>https://technocodex.com/new-citroen-c4-e-c4-details-out-being-considered-for-india/</link>
            <description> Citroen has revealed all details and specifications for the 2020 C4 and the e-C4 hatchback. The good news is that there is a possibility of the C4 coming to India.&#60;p&#62;View Photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is the first time that the Citroen C4 range gets a fully electric variant&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;French car manufacturer, Citroen, has revealed the details and the technical specifications of the 2020 Citroen C4 and the Citroen e-C4. These two models are the tenth generation Citroen hatchbacks, with the first Citroen C4 being launched way back in 1928. While the design of the cars was revealed earlier this month, Citroen has now furnished us with the most important detail of them all. Engine options! The new-generation C4 will get petrol and diesel engines along with a fully electric variant, for the first time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Citroen C4 and e-C4 Revealed&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(The Citroen C4 range will get 5 petrol engines, 2 diesel engines and a fully electric variant too)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The electric C4 or the e-C4 gets a 50 kWh lithium-ion battery which gives it a WLTP (World Harmonised Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure) certified range of 350 kilometres. The electric motor makes 134.1 bhp and the peak torque figure is rated at 260 Nm, which is instantly available. The 0-100 kmph sprint time is 9.7 seconds in sport mode and the top speed is rated at 150 kmph. The electric Citroen C4 can be charged up to 80 per cent in 30 mins via a 100 kW public fast-charger. At home, one can get either a 32 ampere wall box charger, that can fully charge the car in seven and a half hours while the optional 11 kW charger can fully top up the charge in five hours. There are five petrol engine options and two diesel engine options available with a combination of manual and automatic gearboxes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: COVID-19 Pandemic Pushes Citroen C5 Aircross India Launch To 2021&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(The Citroen e-C4 gets a 50 kWh high-voltage battery, which promises a range of 350 km. The electric motor makes 134 bhp and 260 Nm)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In terms of styling, the Citroen C4 and the e-C4 are quite similar and employ a coupe SUV kind of a design with a sloping roofline at the rear. The front end is typically sharp, with a slim grille, angular headlamps and the distinct double line DRLs. The hatchbacks also get differently coloured bumpers and cladding at the sides for that sense of ruggedness. The rear is stylishly done too, with a muscular boot and good-looking tail lamps. The design language is completely new and we believe this new design sense could make its way to all new small cars from Citroen, particularly those which have a chance of being launched in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(The Citroen C4 will have a long list of features inside the cabin)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In terms of features, the new Citroen C4 range gets up to 20 new driver assistance technologies such as active safety brake, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, highway driver assist and much more. The C4 is going to be rich in features too! It will be a connected car offering navigation, emergency services, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and so on. It also gets wireless charging for smartphones, a 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system with voice recognition, a connected HD camera with GPS with 16 GB memory and much more. Other features include ambient lighting, panoramic sunroof, heated seats, rear AC vents and an Arkamys 8-channel audio system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;0 Comments&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Citroen says the new C4 range is more spacious than before. It has a wheelbase of 2,670 mm, 198 mm knee room at the rear and a boot with a capacity of 380 litres. If it does indeed get launched in India, The Citroen C4 range will not be coming before the end of 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest auto news and reviews, follow carandbike on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

However, if youre looking for something to complain about, then the trucks styling is arguably a weak point. Even though Ford says most of the body panels are new, it still looks a lot like the previous generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Sketch Monkey aims to fix this shortcoming in a new video. In his view, the 2021 F-150 looks too much like the latest GMC Sierra. To fix it, he gives the Fords a boxier shape that looks really attractive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The change creates bracket-shaped running lights that outline the top and outer edge of the headlights. A portion of the body then breaks the line, and it continues in the lamps for the fog lights.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The effect of this fairly minor design change is that the F-150 looks blunter and more muscular. It fits the demeanor of the truck very well. The Sketch Monkey also lifts the ride height and fits wheels with knobby tires. This is a perfect match for the tougher look at the front of the pickup.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ford is making sure buyers have lots of styling choices for their new F-150 by building the truck with 11 different grille designs. They vary from simple black plastic on the entry-level XL trim to a silver design with horizontal slats on the range-topping Limited. There are various chrome designs on other models, too. Plus, we are fairly certain that the forthcoming Raptor would have yet another different look.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 2021 Ford F-150 will go on sale this fall. Estimates suggest prices would start at about $30,000 for the base model and go to around $70,000 for the Limited. Loading up options would take those numbers even higher.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

After careful consideration and joint consultations with our shareholders and management, we have decided to, from July 1, kickstart a plan to lower employee costs and promote the companys strategic reorganization.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton produces all of its vehicles at a plant in Nanjing. Starting Wednesday it will suspend most operations in China, where its activities include research and development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In April, industry website Electrek reported that Byton had put hundreds of employees from its Santa Clara facility in California on furlough.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton was launched in September 2017 by Future Mobility Corp, a company co-founded by former BMW and Nissan executives, and also has software and design facilities in the United States and Germany.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton earlier this year said it planned to launch sales of its first product, the M-Byte electric crossover, in Germany, Switzerland, Norway, France, the Netherlands and Sweden in the second half of 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The automaker said in November it received licenses to sell the vehicle in California in a move that Byton said paves the way for North American sales in 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Byton is among a series of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturing startups that have emerged in recent years to challenge foreign companies like Tesla.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China, which has been eager to curb smog and spur its own auto industry, has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles to account for 25 percent of auto sales by 2025, up from around 5 percent currently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the appetite to fund such startups began falling last year and has been dealt a further, heavy blow by the coronavirus pandemic, leaving a number fighting to survive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In May, sales of NEVs fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, Chinas largest auto industry association said. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bloomberg contributed to this report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

Well, that continues to be the same even today with diesel still being 10 paise costlier than petrol in the national capital. Diesel is being retailed at  80.53 per litre in Delhi today while a litre of petrol will cost you  80.43. Delhi is also the only city today thats retailing diesel at a higher price compared to petrol.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Petrol And Diesel Price Revision Halts After 21 Days&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Petrol remains costlier than diesel in other cities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Petrol prices continued the upward trend. Petrol prices in Mumbai are highest at  87.19 per litre, the gap between petrol and diesel is  8.36 per litre with diesel being retailed at  78.83 per litre. In Chennai petrol is being retailed at  83.63 per litre while diesel is being retailed at  77.72 per litre, with the difference being of  5.91 per litre. In Kolkata, petrol has been priced at  82.10 per litre while diesel will cost you  75.64 per litre which is a gap of  6.46 per litre.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Petrol, Diesel Prices Hiked; 21 Days And Counting&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The sudden inflation in fuel prices was expected as an aftershock to the dipping global crude oil prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;0 Comments&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On June 24 in Delhi, the price of diesel was increased by 48 paisa to  79.88 per litre from Rs 79.40 per litre, while the rate of petrol was left unchanged at Rs 79.76 per litre, according to notifications from state-run Indian Oil Corporation which happens to be Indias largest fuel retailer. In the last 18 days, the price of petrol has been increased by a cumulative Rs 9.41 per litre in Delhi, while diesel price went up by Rs 9.58 per litre. The sudden inflation in fuel prices was expected as an aftershock of the dipping global crude oil prices which hit a 21-year low of $15.98 per barrel in April, owing to coronavirus pandemic. Global oil rates have recovered to an extent due to the easing of restrictions on transport and industrial activity which boosted fuel demand around the globe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest auto news and reviews, follow carandbike on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

Main actor: The Ford GT40 and the legendary race in Le Mans 1966.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While Le Mans is already a place with a special racing history  and has already been ennobled by Steve McQueen with his film adaptation of Le Mans  the film LE Mans 66 has once again focused on one of the most powerful and spectacular vehicles in automotive history.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The subsequent events in Le Mans need not be recounted for long  they and the Ford GT40, which was developed and built for this sole purpose at the time, have been both motorsport history and cult since their furious triple victory in Le Mans in 1966. Everyone knows the story. Everyone knows the Ford GT40.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So what could have been more obvious to refine the new edition of this legendary vehicle  which should not be missing in any renowned collectors garage worldwide  under the new abbreviation Ford GT by MANSORY and thus make it even more desirable? The result:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ford GT Le MANSORY.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In Geneva 2020 MANSORY will present the Le MANSORY for the first time in a worldwide limited edition of 6 conversions in total, thus adding another exciting chapter to the rich history of the Ford GT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Le MANSORY shows unmistakably and impressively why the worldwide reputation of the complete vehicle conversions from MANSORY have become that which has distinguished the MANSORY brand for 30 years now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Le MANSORY convinces and impresses the observer at first sight thanks to its 5 cm wider full carbon body including its extensive changes in the aerodynamic area and makes the heart of every motorsport enthusiast beat faster.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In addition to the impressive first impression, the standard output of the V6 twin-turbo engine of 483 KW (656 hp) has been increased to a demanding and appropriate 710 hp by extensive modifications to the engine management system, enabling the Le MANSORY in combination with adapted aerodynamics to achieve a top speed of 354 km/h (standard: 347 km/h) almost effortlessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chassis modifications and the use of forged rims of the dimensions 9&#195;&#151;21 (front) and 12&#195;&#151;21 (rear) type YN.5 with corresponding high-performance tyres Continental Sport Contact 6 round off the appearance in an elegant and harmonious way and also playfully master the massively increased performance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the LED main headlights, which have been completely newly and exclusively developed for the Le MANSORY, are of particular interest. This lighting system, which is divided into four individual headlights, gives the Le MANSORY a completely independent look, which on the one hand clearly distinguishes it from the standard, rather round Ford GT, but on the other hand also gives it the best possible citation and, thanks to newly drawn contours and enlarged air inlets, gives it the optical brilliance that makes the Le MANSORY so unmistakable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the interior, which Ford has kept rather spartan as standard, almost not one single component was left untouched by the MANSORY specialists  as is usual with all MANSORY complete conversions. While the car is dominated exclusively by the colour blue named Bleurion Race and the visible carbon fibre in dark grey, the interior of the dashboard and the sports seats are also lined in white-blue Alcantara. The numerous carbon applications distributed throughout the entire passenger cell complement and compose the interior into a harmonious whole.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Le MANSORY is limited to 3 units worldwide.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

            <title>Drastic Covid-19 Slowdown May Hinder Any Green Recovery</title>
            <link>https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/drastic-covid-19-slowdown-may-hinder-any-green-recovery</link>
            <description> (Bloomberg) -- As Covid-19 spread across the globe this spring, flights were halted, commutes were cancelled and oil tankers floated offshore, waiting for a spike in demand.&#60;p&#62; The coronavirus cut global carbon emissions more than any other event in the last century. But the pandemic-induced slowdown may ultimately hamper efforts to curb climate change.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If we end up in a deep recession, that will cut emissions in the short term. But in the long term, the increase in emissions from less clean energy investment could easily outweigh those short-term reductions, said Kenneth Gillingham, associate professor of economics at Yale and lead author of a new study on possible climate outcomes from the virus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Daily U.S. carbon emissions dropped 15% overall from March to early June, according to the new study. Energy use from jet fuel was halved while gasoline fell by 30%, but Gillingham noted there are cheaper ways to reduce emissions than an economic slowdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The researchers model two possible paths forward. In one, Covid-19 is controlled soon and the economy is completely reopened by the end of the year, (the best-case scenario). In another, the virus continues to spread, causing a global recession (which the researchers consider more likely). In the latter scenario, the researchers estimate an additional 2.5 billion metric tons of CO2 would be emitted by 2035, or the equivalent of 6.8% of 2019 CO2 emissions from energy. The IPCC has set a goal of halving global emissions by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While emissions would drop in the short-term under the likely scenario, the economics of the situation would lead to a larger rise over the long time. Long-term investment in the energy sector would lag, and low electricity costs could draw funds away from renewable energy. Sales of electric vehicles would also suffer, and there'd be less new infrastructure for charging them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The research team concluded permanent energy consumption would need to be reduced by 4% to offset their projected delay in investments.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Government response, however, is the wild card that can change everything, according to the study. The emergence of the virus initially drew the world's focus from climate issues. Now, as governments inject money into their economies, many are making sure those funds have green strings attached . The European Union, United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea are all considering stimulus bills that include a focus on clean energy, according to Gillingham and his co-authors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There are a myriad of ways the U.S. government could back green initiatives with its stimulus funds, but the $2.2 trillion CARES act passed in March was stripped of green earmarks . Oil companies took advantage of nearly $2 billion in tax benefits provided by the bill.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a 500-page climate plan , including a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The House is also considering a $1.5 trillion stimulus bill that would include $100 billion for transit issues (including electric buses), $70 billion for electric vehicles and grid improvements and $4.5 billion for zero-emission postal trucks. The legislation faces dim prospects in the Republican-controlled Senate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The researchers used data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Highway Administration, among others, and looked at the effects of the 2008 recession to model the potential effects of delayed clean energy investment and emissions, focusing on vehicle fuel economy and renewable electricity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#194;&#169;2020 Bloomberg L.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bloomberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Missing BloombergQuint's WhatsApp service?

            <title>Clean Energy Can Support India's Economic Recovery Post-COVID-19</title>
            <link>https://www.ucnews.in/news/Clean-Energy-Can-Support-Indias-Economic-Recovery-PostCOVID19/3884292118792698.html</link>
            <description> A new report by NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) identifies how COVID-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors.&#60;p&#62;The report recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country's leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India's transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences. The new report, titled Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities for India's Energy and Mobility Sectors, advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said that he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. "India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness," added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. "We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses-the transport and power sectors-and emerge stronger." The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programs to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities," said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India's public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India," said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives," said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. "As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air." The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report can be accessed on the following links: Rocky Mountain Institute: https://rmi.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/ RMI India: https://rmi-india.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/ About NITI Aayog The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, is the premier policy think tank of the Government of India, providing both directional and policy inputs.

            <title>Mamata writes to NITI Aayog for inter-disciplinary team for Sunderbans</title>
            <link>http://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/mamata-writes-to-niti-aayog-for-inter-disciplinary-team-for-sunderbans-411491</link>
            <description> Kolkata: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday urged NITI Aayog to form an inter-disciplinary team to initiate preparation for a masterplan for the Sunderbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site wreaked by frequent cyclones.&#60;p&#62;In a letter to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, she pointed out that the Sunderbans is home to 50 lakh people and has the world's largest single block of mangrove forests, which had received the worst battering "in living memory" by Cyclone Amphan on May 20.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"I would like to request NITI Aayog to kindly commission the preparation of a Master Plan by an inter- disciplinary team of experts covering all aspects of socio-economic development of this ecologically fragile region," she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A central team had visited certain Amphan-ravaged villages in the Sunderbans to assess the extensive damages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Banerjee said the latest trail of devastations reminded of the need for a "systematic review of the multiple challenge faced by the Sunderbans and calls for a scientifically designed development package for its protection and balanced socio-economic development."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any review of the manifold challenges of Sunderbans will require a pool of experts drawn from the relevant disciplines as also technical assistance from international multilateral bodies. "It will also require funding support from the government of India," she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Okhla landfill to churn out power, SDMC inks pact with NTPC, IOC</title>
            <link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/okhla-landfill-to-churn-out-power-sdmc-inks-pact-with-ntpc-ioc/articleshow/76719354.cms</link>
            <description> New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will use the Okhla landfill site s garbage to produce syn gasa hydrogen-based fuel which will be later used to generate electricity. An MoU to set up a pilot project with a capacity to treat 50 tonnes of garbage per day was signed between the civic body, Indian Oil and NTPC on Tuesday.&#60;p&#62;SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the project will help in addressing the problem of garbage disposal. The plant will process 50 tonnes per day of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) segregated from municipal solid waste to produce syn gas which will be used to generate about 1 MW electricity, Bharti added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The municipal corporation will provide 1 acre of land at the Okhla site on lease to Indian Oil for setting up the processing plant. SDMC will also purchase the power generated from the plant. We will be able to save Rs 2.6 crores due to the purchase of power from the plant, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmender Pradhan, LG Anil Baijal and SDMC functionaries participated in the MoU signing event through a video link.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indian Oil and NTPC will make an investment of 50% each towards the capital cost involved in setting up the plant through a consortium. Indian Oil will facilitate the technology and handle the whole operation of the proposed plant, while NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation, said a civic official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This plant is an indigenous solution to solid waste problem and will help SDMC in achieving 100% waste processing. We will try to replicate the plan in other areas in future, said Anamika, south Delhi mayor.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union minister Pradhan added that Delhi generates 10,000 tonnes of waste every day and it is a challenge to manage and process the entire quantity. Such plants will go a long way in production of enriched organic manure, generation of electricity and treatment of effluent water, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LG Anil Baijal said that such innovative undertakings will definitely reduce accumulation of municipal solid waste at landfill sites and will pave way for remediation of legacy waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said the proposed plant is an example of two ministries coming together for a good public cause just the way the prime minister talks about breaking silos.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Synthesised gas is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which acts as a clean fuel. This project is based on clean technology and no pollution will be caused, added the civic official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T flags off final assembly of cryostat for $20-billion fusion reactor</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/lt-flags-off-final-assembly-of-cryostat-for-20-bn-fusion-reactor-6484153/</link>
            <description> The cryostats function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;p&#62;The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) Tuesday flagged off the final assembly of a cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber to Cadarache in France. The company has already delivered the base section, lower cylinder and upper cylinder for the cryostat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostats function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T Heavy Engineering won the contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012. It was conducted in collaboration with seven countries including India and the project outlay is around $20 billion. L&#38;Ts scope of work for the cryostat was to the tune of Rs 1,300 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Explaining the projects importance, Anil V Parab, executive vice-president &#38; head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering, said this is the first time a 500-megawatt reactor has been built which is the commercial demonstration of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T non-executive chairman AM Naik on Tuesday was quoted by PTI as saying he was apprehensive of bidding for the Rs 1,338-crore ITERs cryostat contract for the worlds largest experimental thermo-nuclear fusion reactor in Cadarache as it was considered as too risky a bet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts management bandwidth and teams executing such an enormous project and that too far from India  this we have never done nor had done before. Hence the project was perceived to be too risky, Naik said during the virtual flag-off ceremony of the final assembly at L&#38;Ts Hazira manufacturing complex. However, Naik called it moment of pride for India and Larsen &#38; Toubro.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, said, This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site  and eventually lead to the demonstration of large scale feasibility of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;?

            <title>Musk tells Tesla employees breaking even in 2Q will be tight</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/international/1111024-musk-tells-tesla-employees-breaking-even-in-2q-will-be-tight</link>
            <description> With one day left before the second quarter closes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is telling employees that prospects for the company breaking even for the&#60;p&#62;three-month period are tight, and he's asking them to go all-out to make it happen. Tesla is trying to avoid a quarterly loss despite its Fremont, California, factory being shut down for nearly two months due to coronavirus restrictions. The company also has a plant in China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In an email message Monday to the company's workers, Musk wrote that it really makes a difference for every car you build and deliver. Tesla had about 48,000 workers at the end of last year. Tesla is expected to announce its quarterly deliveries on Thursday, but has not set a date to release its second-quarter financial numbers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The electric car and solar panel company is cranking out the new Model Y smaller SUV as it tries to break even or make money. Many owners, though, have reported on forums and social media that their vehicles were delivered with mismatched paint or poorly fitting body panels. While some rejected the vehicles, many others wrote that their Model Ys were flawless. In the first quarter, the Palo Alto, California, company eked out a $16 million net profit, its third-straight profitable quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>UPDATE 1-GM must repay $60 million in state tax credits, Ohio AG says</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/gm-lordstown-taxes/update-1-gm-must-repay-60-million-in-state-tax-credits-ohio-ag-says-idINL1N2E71VN</link>
            <description> WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Tuesday that General Motors Co should repay $60 million in state tax credits after it closed its Lordstown Assembly plant in March 2019.&#60;p&#62; In a brief to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority, Yost said GM in 2009 agreed to maintain operations at its northeast Ohio plant through 2028 and retain 3,700 jobs through 2040 in exchange for the credits. We demand the money that is rightfully owed to Ohio  no more, no less, Yost said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yost's filing said GM did not fulfill its contract. Does any rational person believe that, if the shoe were on the other foot, GM would shrug and walk away from $60 million it paid under a contract when the other party chose not to deliver?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yost cited a 2019 study that GM's Lordstown closure resulted in the loss of nearly 8,000 jobs and more than $8 billion in local economic activity, while the local school district had relied on the plant for 10% of its budget.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; GM said Tuesday it has demonstrated its commitment to Ohio through our investments of more than $3.3 billion in Ohio since 2009 ... We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the state.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As recently as 2016, GM employed 4,500 people at Lordstown and cut the final 1,500 jobs when production of the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze ended.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; GM sold the plant to an electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors that hopes to begin production next year with a few hundred workers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; GM and LG Chem are investing $2.2 billion to build a battery cell manufacturing plant in Lordstown that will create 1,100 jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ohio Governor Mike DeWine told reporters last week the state does not necessarily have to get that cash back but what we do want to see is things that promote jobs in Ohio ... We're not actively pursuing a clawback. (Reporting by David Shepardson, Editing by Franklin Paul and Tom Brown)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"They must be transparent in origin &#38; final destination of data.

Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indians will leverage strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual control in Ladakh.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available onAndroid and iOS platforms for "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures," the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) in 2012 chosen by ITER-India to manufacture and install cryostat - a vacuum pressure ves...&#60;p&#62;The final assembly or top lid sectors of the cryostat, a key part of the world's largest nuclear fusion reactor being built in France, were dispatched on Tuesday from the company'sHazira manufacturing complex in Surat district in Gujarat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) in 2012 chosen by ITER-India to manufacture and install cryostat - a vacuum pressure vessel made of 3,850 tonnes of stainless steel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T Group Chairman AM Naik termed it a "moment of pride for India and Larsen &#38; Toubro".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The heavy engineering arm of L&#38;T, India's leading engineering, construction, technology, manufacturing and financial services conglomerate, has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India initiative," the company said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly weighing 650 tonne is to be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in a reactor pit in southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat. The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A virtual flag-off ceremony of the final assembly was held at the company's Hazira manufacturing complex.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dr Bernard Bigot, Director-General, ITER Global, KN Vyas, Chairman Atomic Energy Commission, India, UK Baruah, Project Director, ITER-India, V K Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog, A M Naik, Group Chairman L&#38;T and SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, joined the ceremony virtually.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Naik said: "It is a moment of pride for India and for L&#38;T in particular -- as we have gathered to flag-off the last section of the Cryostat Vessel for the most ambitious clean energy project limitless carbon free energy that will power the future. L&#38;T has always been proud of this global collaborative research to build a greener planet."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subrahmanyan the company has used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-precision assemblies to ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of largescale feasibility of fusion power. It has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology, Subrahmanyan added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Anil V Parab, Executive Vice President and Head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering told PTI that ITER is a USD 20 billion project and India is contributing 9 per cent of the project component.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"With the supply of the Top Lid sector, we have successfully completed our India scope of the project ahead of the schedule. The fabrication of these components has been an engineering marvel both in terms of its massive size and its stringent quality standards.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering is divided into three aspects, the company said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T's Heavy Engineering business won this prestigious contract from ITER India, a wing of Department of Atomic Energy, for the ambitious mega scientific project, conducted in collaboration of seven elite countries, including India, and with a project outlay of around USD 20 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Shareable electric scooters will be trialed in the UK from July 4th</title>
            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareable-electric-scooters-legal-pilot-july-4-171550748.html</link>
            <description> More It's taken a while, but the UK is ready to embrace shareable electric scooter schemes.&#60;p&#62;In a press release , the Department for Transport announced that select trials will be allowed from July 4th. For now, it's unclear which companies and regions will be offering such services. The government confirmed, however, that the first pilots will likely start next week and run for 12 months. "The option for trials to continue beyond this 12-month period will be built into the legal mechanism, but any extension would be subject to local [and] national government agreement," it added in new guidance released for local authorities and rental operators.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If you fancy using one of these services, you'll need a full or provisional car, motorcycle or moped licence. You won't need to wear a helmet -- though the UK government recommends one -- or complete any kind of training course beforehand. To avoid breaking the law, you'll also need to stay off the sidewalk and ride on roads, cycle lanes and tracks instead.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Providers, meanwhile, will need to ensure they have an insurance policy that covers all of their vehicles. Electric scooters will also need to be capped at 15.5 MPH (25 KMH), matching pedal-assisted e-bikes in the UK.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Until now, electric scooters have been classed as motor vehicles' by law. Most of them don't meet the design standards of a conventional car or motorcycle and were, therefore, illegal to use on public roads. It's long been possible, however, to buy an electric scooter from high street retailers such as Halfords , and the number of people riding on roads and sidewalks has slowly risen over the last few years. Today's announcement doesn't affect private ownership, though the government has expressed broad interest in legalizing micromobility vehicles including electric skateboards.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "[Electric] scooters may offer the potential for convenient, clean and cost-effective travel that may also help ease the burden on the transport network, provide another green alternative to get around and allow for social distancing," Rachel Maclean, the UK's transport minister said. "The trials will allow us to test whether they do these things."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The UK appears to be taking a slow and cautious approach to the so-called "last mile" solution. And with good reason: electric scooters were a chaotic mess when they first appeared in the US. Rentable scooters flooded San Francisco in March 2018, before spreading to countless other cities including Miami and New Orleans. They were incredibly popular, but some users rode them dangerously and the sheer number of vehicles led to cluttered sidewalks that were difficult for wheelchair users to navigate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The following month, San Francisco officials sent cease-and-desist orders to scooter companies operating in the area and forced them to apply for a one-year pilot program instead. Skip and Scoot were awarded permits later that summer, but many other companies including Uber and Lyft weren't so lucky. The following year , the city kicked out Skip, re-approved Scoot and allowed Jump and Lime to join the fray. Rentable scooters are still divisive, however the level of debate and discontent appears to have cooled off as more US cities understand and regulate the industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Electric scooters can be unlocked and ridden in many European cities, too, including Paris Rome Berlin and Copenhagen . Just like the US, though, they've faced a fair amount of criticism.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Rentable scooters are still divisive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The UK, meanwhile, has barely dabbled with the technology. A small batch of Bird scooters were offered temporarily at London's Olympic Park in 2018. As Wired reports , the area is technically private land, which meant that the company didn't need any special permission from the government.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The situation changed when the UK's Department for Transportation published a policy paper called  Future of mobility: urban strategy ' in March 2019. The 78-page document explained some basic principles that will guide its future decision making and suggested that a flexible regulatory framework was needed for 'last mile' electric vehicles. The following year , the government announced a &#194;&#163;90 million fund to trial new forms of transportation in four Future Transport Zones' across the UK.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It also kicked off a consultation on electric scooters with a public call for evidence that runs until July 3rd.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That same month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a partial lockdown which banned non-essential travel and limited residents to one form of outdoor exercise each day. It was a temporary measure, though, and everyone knew there would be a need for electric bicycles, scooters and other single-person vehicles once the restrictions were relaxed and more people started commuting to work again.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So, on May 9th, the government announced a &#194;&#163;2 billon (roughly $2.4 billion) fund that would support walking, cycling and other alternative ways to travel that could reduce the number of people taking buses, trains and subway systems like the London Underground. As part of that announcement, the government said it would bring e-scooter trials forward from next year to next month. Legislators also revealed that the electric vehicles would be offered to all local areas across the country, rather than four Future Transport Zone sites.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All of that work has culminated in today's announcement. It's not clear how the rules will be enforced and what the punishment will be for riders and scooter providers that break them. The measures announced today don't address the 'pavement clutter' issue, either. "Where a dockless operating model is being used, local authorities should ensure that e-scooters do not become obstructive to other road users and pedestrians, particularly those with disabilities," the guidance simply reads.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The pressure is on scooter companies, therefore, to prove that they've learned from other markets and the UK bike-sharing schemes that were so divisive a couple of years ago. If there's a public backlash, it could affect how electric scooters are seen and regulated in the future. That's because the government's "Future of mobility" review -- the one with a consultation that ends in July -- is still ongoing and could influence any laws that are drafted or changed following the 12-month pilots.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> By Sudarshan Varadhan CHENNAI (Reuters) - India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output. 'This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year,'India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday&#60;p&#62;Reuters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;By Sudarshan Varadhan&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CHENNAI (Reuters) - India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency Moody's Indian unit ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9% between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7% this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Giles Elgood)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Updated Date:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The renewable energy industry is one of the major FDI earners with the sector attracting $4.8 billion foreign capital till 2019 end since FY15.&#60;p&#62;The auction had received a positive response from investors with SECI receiving bids of about 4,800 MW for the tender.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;X&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The auction had received a positive response from investors with SECI receiving bids of about 4,800 MW for the tender. (Representative image)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The latest solar auction has discovered a tariff of Rs 2.36/unit, a new low. The lowest tariff found previously was Rs 2.44/unit in the July 2018 auction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The response to the current round of auction for 2,000 MW capacity from domestic and foreign developers has been strong, marking a gradual shift from the recent trend of solar tenders being under-subscribed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to sources, Spanish firm Solarpacks Indian arm quoted the lowest tariff for building 300 MW solar project, marking its entry in its first large-scale solar auction. Avikiran Surya (backed by Italian utility Enel), New York-based Eden Renewables Indian unit, a subsidiary of Germanys Ib Vogt have been awarded 300 MW each, at Rs 2.37/unit. Amp Energy Green bid Rs 2.37/unit for 100 MW capacity. Ayana Renewable Power which is backed by UKs CDC and ReNew Power have been allotted 300 MW and 400 MW, respectively, against their final quotes of Rs 2.38/unit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The auction had received a positive response from investors with SECI receiving bids of about 4,800 MW for the tender. As it was with the last major solar tender auctioned by SECI in February, the winning developers are backed mostly by foreign capital. The renewable energy industry is one of the major FDI earners with the sector attracting $4.8 billion foreign capital till 2019 end since FY15.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country has set a target to raise the capacity of installed renewable energy generation plants from the current level of 86.8 GW to 175 GW by the end of 2022. About 35 GW is under various stages of implementation and 32 GW under various stages of bidding. If the 45.7 GW of hydro and 6.8 GW of nuclear capacities are included, the target under the Paris climate change accord of having 40% of installed power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources can be achieved by 2022 itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;mail logo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to FE Daily Newsletter for latest updates on markets, business, money, infra &#38; more, right in your mailbox&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> June 30 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp has given the state of Wyoming until July 8 to bid on the company's land and minerals properties in Wyoming and Colorado, the Wyoming governor's office said.&#60;p&#62; Wyoming plans to hold a public hearing before it decides if it will bid on the properties, a spokesman for the governor said on Tuesday. Occidental acquired the land and minerals with its 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Occidental's initial deadline to submit bids was July 1.

            <description> MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday ordered formal complaints to be drawn up alleging fraud by mostly renewable power companies, but he gave no evidence backing up the complaints.&#60;p&#62; FILE PHOTO: Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during a news conference in Mexico City, Mexico June 24, 2020. Mexico's Presidency/Handout via REUTERS&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ramping up his repeated allegations of corruption in power generation contracts won by mostly wind and solar power companies, Lopez Obrador said that while he remains open to dialogue with the companies, he also wants his aides to prepare the legal complaints against them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We want to talk to the companies one by one. At the same time, I've given the order to begin drawing up formal complaints, Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lopez Obrador, who has moved on several fronts to centralize more control over energy in state hands, alleged that after the private power firms won supply contracts at auction with state-run electricity company CFE that additional deals were inked that gave them preferential rates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He provided no evidence to support the allegation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since April, the government has sought to prevent more than 40 wind and solar power plants from connecting to the CFE-owned grid, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic requires an uninterrupted power supply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Critics have alleged that Lopez Obrador instead seeks to favor the CFE's mostly fossil fuel-derived power generation, and that he is generally suspicious of any private-sector participation in energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier this month, the president singled out Spain's Iberdrola ( ) for criticism, accusing the power generation company of mounting a media campaign against his government as well as unspecified acts of graft.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Tuesday, Lopez Obrador did not mention any specific companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The power sector dispute directly affects more than $6 billion in partially or already built wind and solar power plants, which judges have allowed to proceed as planned despite the government push to stop them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Additional reporting and writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Aurora Ellis&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Why are the Japanese so resilient?</title>
            <link>https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200630-why-are-the-japanese-so-resilient</link>
            <description> Regularly pummelled by natural disasters, Japan has frequently had to bounce back from adversity. But this, some argue, has bred fortitude and a cultural trait of resilience.&#60;p&#62; By Karen Gardiner&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the Shorinzan Darumaji temple in Takasaki, 130km north of Tokyo, visitors are greeted by hundreds of squat dolls piled atop one another. Each doll, most painted red, features a moustachioed face with large, black eyes frozen in a look of stern determination. These are Daruma, modelled on Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism in China, and Japan's most popular good-luck charm. Farmers in Takasaki began making the hollow, papier-m&#195;&#162;ch&#195;&#169; dolls around 200 years ago, and the area continues to make the majority that are sold and found in homes throughout Japan.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Visitors to the temple can buy their own Daruma, which will have two blank eyes. The purchaser then makes a wish and colours in the pupil of its left eye. After the wish is fulfilled, the purchaser fills in the second pupil. As the year comes to a close, visitors donate their Daruma to the temple and buy a new one to make another wish or to renew their commitment to achieving their goals. The piles of dolls at Shorinzan Darumaji are those that have served their purpose and will be burned in a ceremony in the new year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But the Daruma represents something more profound than simply a good-luck charm. Each Daruma is weighted at the base and you can rock it from side to side, but it will never tip over: a symbol of perseverance for a nation that has often been pushed close to its limit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Regularly pummelled by natural  and several manmade  disasters, Japan has frequently had to bounce back from adversity. In the last 100 years, Japan has endured the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which flattened Tokyo; two nuclear bombs, over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; the Kobe earthquake of 1995, which, just two months later, was followed by the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack; and the triple shock of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in the Tohoku region in 2011. Just last year, in October, Typhoon Hagibis caused widespread destruction and death. But adversity, some argue, has bred fortitude and a cultural trait of resilience.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; You may also be interested in:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Japan's formula for life satisfaction&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Why is New Zealand so progressive?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Japan's naked art of body positivity&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Like the Daruma doll that always recovers as it falls down, said Dr Joshua W Walker, who grew up in Japan and is president and CEO of the Japan Society in New York City, Japan is a model of resiliency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Daruma serves as a reminder that no matter how many times you may get knocked down, you must always get back up. Strongly connected to this ideology and to the Daruma itself is the Japanese proverb  nana korobi ya oki , which translates to seven times down, eight times up; as is the spirit of ganbaru (to endure), a trait that is instilled in Japanese children from a young age.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Spend an extended length of time in Japan and you'll likely come to notice the language of resilience and stoicism present in everyday speech. Words such as  shoganai  or, formally,  shikata ga nai  (it can't be helped)  along with ganbaru's imperative form, ganbatte (do your best) and the noun gaman (perseverance)  often appear in conversation, reflecting the fact that tenacity is a highly regarded and celebrated trait.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Travellers can learn, not only from the earthquake and nuclear accident, but also from reconstruction and overcoming adversity&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While you're more likely to hear the language of resilience refer to fairly banal situations  shoganai when you miss the train; ganbatte before you sit a test  it is entwined with some of Japan's most traumatic experiences. In a 1945 radio address by Emperor Hirohito, who was then considered a living deity, he called on the Japanese to endure the unendurable and suffer what is not sufferable as the nation prepared for the humiliation of unconditional surrender and economic collapse at the end of World War Two.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, international observers were struck by the calm and civility on display as people formed orderly queues outside shops and largely refrained from looting : actions that were often attributed to the gaman spirit. Japanese restraint is steeped in a culture of tested resilience read a March 2011 headline in the Los Angeles Times . The slogan exhorting ganbaro Tohoku (the inclusive form of ganbaru; meaning roughly, let's hang in there) abounded on signs in public places and on the Web.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But this spirit of resilience is not without its criticism. An April 2011 article in The Economist titled Silenced by gaman argued that the exhortation smacks of heads-down endurance, rather than the hope of better things to come and that people in Tohoku are beginning to resent the phrase, because it sounds like a demand to endure even more. A Japan Times piece argued that gaman leads to a passive tolerance of disaster, a panacea, absolving people of a need to do more. Another criticised the exasperating fatalism of shoganai.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Time magazine, however, suggests that the fatalism implied in the phrase [shoganai] denotes not just a helplessness at life's vagaries but also a calm determination to overcome what cannot be controlled.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Even more than overcoming it, Dr Walker believes that Japan bends adversity; that, rather than grimly enduring hardship, it gets back up and emerges stronger. For example, the rebuilding of Tokyo after the 1923 earthquake  and again after the 1945 bombing by the American Air Force  transformed it into a modern city. Hiroshima wasn't just rebuilt, it was completely reimagined as a Peace Memorial City symbolising what the 1949 Construction Law called the sincere pursuit of genuine and lasting peace. And the Kobe earthquake is now considered the turning point in Japanese civil engagement, having led to the now-entrenched trend of post-disaster volunteerism. After the Tohoku triple disaster, rebuilding projects and those pursuing alternatives to nuclear energy sprung up around the Tohoku region's Fukushima prefecture  and now growing tourism in the area means that visitors can see this first-hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For the last few years, the Fukushima prefectural government has been promoting the concept of hope tourism , which allows visitors to see the current state of disaster-affected areas and meet locals involved in shaping its future. Takehiro Okamoto, who organises Hope Tours through the travel company Wondertrunk &#38; Co , explains that hope tourism is the antonym of dark tourism. In Fukushima, he said, Travellers can learn, not only from the earthquake and nuclear accident, but also from reconstruction and overcoming adversity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Participants, Okamoto explained, visit disaster-affected areas and related sites, including the road near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the TEPCO Decommissioning Archive Center , where they learn about the current decommissioning efforts of the plant. The highlight, Okamoto told me, is talking and workshopping with local people. Participants start thinking about our future: issues to do with energy, local communities and an overly consumerist culture.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; After the 2011 disaster, Okamoto said there was a trend towards renewable energy throughout Japan. A grassroots movement to reassess nuclear energy was mobilised in the disaster's aftermath, leading to some of the biggest protests the country had seen in decades. All nuclear power plants were stopped and investment for solar power was increased, he explained.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unfortunately, said Okamoto, reflecting on the anti-nuclear movement, we couldn't change the whole Japanese energy policy. In August 2015, after standing idle for four years, the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant on Kyushu was the first of Japan's nuclear power plants to restart its reactors. In Fukushima, however, the local government aims to power the region with 100% renewable energy by 2040.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There is a philosophical understanding that life inevitability includes disasters and triumphs that are bigger than the individual in the circle of life&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Okamoto sees the seeds of a brighter future in the area generally, pointing to a new highway connecting Tohoku's long-isolated coastal region to central Tohoku and Tokyo; as well as the new Michinoku Coastal Trail , a 1,000k-long path that runs along Japan's rarely visited north-eastern coast through four prefectures affected by the earthquake and tsunami.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He also sees hope tourism as a way of keeping the impact of the disaster in mind. For Japanese people, the memory of accidents fades away as time goes by. So, we want to remind [them] and rethink issues throughout our travels [by] talking with local people. Okamoto says that Japan's many experiences of disasters has led to its people being very patient and united but, at the same time, we [find it] easy to forget; easy to make the same mistake again.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Dr Walker, however, seems more optimistic that the world, now more than ever, can learn from Japan's attitude. There is a philosophical understanding [in Japan] that life inevitability includes disasters and triumphs that are bigger than the individual in the circle of life, he said, which is a particularly relevant and useful mindset in the current period we find ourselves globally.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was due to begin in Fukushima in late March. The flame would have symbolised the region's recovery from the events nine years ago to the month. However, with the postponement of the Games , the relay was cancelled. If the Olympics do take place in 2021, it's likely that its emphasis will shift to recovery from a more recent, and global, disaster: the coronavirus pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As fear of radiation slowly begins to fade, another invisible dread has taken its place, a situation that most of us have no choice but to endure and, perhaps, hope for a better world in the aftermath. It's a reminder that adversity is an inevitable part of life. As much of the world has retreated indoors, in Takasaki, the piles of Daruma sit, stoic as ever. It's a potent symbol: the reason the squat little dolls are traditionally painted red is that, during Japan's Edo period, they were used as talismans against the smallpox virus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Why We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook , or follow us on Twitter and Instagram&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called "The Essential List".

            <title>Relief for pharma firms as govt starts clearing API imports from China</title>
            <link>https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/relief-for-pharma-firms-as-govt-starts-clearing-api-imports-from-china-120070100060_1.html</link>
            <description> This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at Indian ports.&#60;p&#62;Easing restrictions on imports from China, the Customs department has decided to clear pharma raw material shipments from that country. Consignments of 11 top importers, including LG, Samsung, Toyota, Honda, and Siemens, will also be allowed entry, relieving them of the 100 per cent inspection rule.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indian ports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After representations from industry bodies, the government on Tuesday cleared imports of active pharma ingredients (APIs) from China. Besides, the top importers falling within the Tier 3 category of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme were given exemption from stringent scrutiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Imports of APIs and shipments from AEO T3 importers have been exempt from the 100 per cent check. The Indian pharma industry is heavily dependent on API imports from China and they were facing a huge shortage of raw material. Besides, the tier 3 AEOs are the top importers who meet the highest level of compliance, so they have been given the relaxation, said a government official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO READ: Indian IT services firms relying less on visas as approval rates nosedive&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said these shipments would get moving from Wednesday. Over 60 per cent of APIs used in India come from China. On June 22, Customs officials in Chennai and Vizag were asked to put all shipments from China on hold until further orders. This was done on the basis of intelligence inputs about illegal imports of narcotics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Informal instructions were given to all ports and airports to do 100 per cent physical checks of shipments originating in China. Bilateral trade between China and India was worth $88 billion in FY19, with a deficit of $53.5 billion in Chinas favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is also heavily dependent on China for intermediates and key starting material (KSM) for making drugs. This dependence has grown over the years as local manufacturers have moved to high-margin products (after they could not expand freely due to pollution norms) and Chinese APIs are 30 per cent cheaper than domestic stuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country mostly imports APIs and intermediates for vitamins (like Vitamin C), common antibiotics, and metformin (diabetes) from China. The government has now drawn up a plan to reduce dependence on the country by incentivising the local production of APIs through production-linked incentives (PLI) of up to Rs 10 crore. The government has identified 41 products (molecules), covering 53 crucial APIs, for which India is dependent on China. Almost 80 per cent of the 41 are intermediates. In 2016, the Customs department had launched the Authorised Economic Operator, or AEO, scheme. It is a voluntary programme, under which an importer gets preferential treatment from Customs for being compliant with supply-chain security standards. AEOs get benefits like fast-tracking shipments, deferred payments, exemption from issuing guarantees, and preferential treatment from Customs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They are classified into three categories  T1, T2, and T3  with T3 representing the highest level of compliance. Of the more than 3,000 AEOs, only 11 are in the T3 category. Meanwhile, the government is planning to curtail imports of at least 300 non-essential items from China, either through duty hikes and imposing non-tariff barriers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Read our full coverage on Indian Pharmaceuticals Industry&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Broad Energy Industry Coalition Encourages PJM to Continue to Examine Carbon Pricing in its Electricity Market</title>
            <link>https://www.pressreleasepoint.com/broad-energy-industry-coalition-encourages-pjm-continue-examine-carbon-pricing-its-electricity</link>
            <description> Screen Shot 2020-06-30 at 10.02.42 AM-1&#60;p&#62;June 30, 2020 Washington D.C.  As U.S. policymakers look for cost-effective ways to tackle climate change, a diverse coalition of power generators, trade associations, and think tanks last week sent a letter encouraging PJM to continue its examination of the policy options and implications of carbon pricing in its market. The request comes at a time when many states in PJM either have, or are considering, policies that reduce carbon emissions in the electric sector and are grappling with how best to reconcile those policies with wholesale markets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As states consider policy levers to reduce carbon emissions and integrate cleaner power generation technology, carbon pricing can be a powerful, efficient, and cost-effective tool to drive down emissions and help achieve state goals, while preserving the economic benefits of competitive wholesale electricity markets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The request does not recommend that PJM integrate a carbon price into its market at this time, or the specific method by which it could do so in the future. Rather, in light of the continued and heightened focus by states in the PJM market on reducing carbon emissions from power generation, the letter emphasizes the impor tance of PJM continuing its efforts to consider integrating carbon pricing in its market and exploring the practical, technical, and implementation issues related to how PJMs markets can potentially account for state policy through carbon pricing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The letters full list of signatories: Advanced Energy Economy, American Council on Renewable Energy, American Wind Energy Association, Apex Clean Energy, Aztec Solar, BayWa r.e. Solar Projects, Clearway Energy Group, Competitive Power Ventures, Cypress Creek Renewables, Delaware Division of the Public Advocate, Eastern Generation, Ecoplexus, EDF Renewables, EDP Renewables North America, Enel North America, ENGIE North America, First Solar, Invenergy, Lightsource BP, Natural Gas Supply Association, Orsted North America, Pine Gate Renewables, Recurrent Energy, R Street Institute, RWE Renewables Americas, Skyline Renewables, Solar Energy Industries Association, Southern Current, and Vistra Energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Asian markets extended the gains of the previous trading session of the US markets, which were up as investors continued to focus on economies reopening in spite of the rising Covid toll in the country.&#60;p&#62;The benchmark Sensex was down by 45.72 points or 0.13% to close at 34,915.8.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The benchmark Sensex was down by 45.72 points or 0.13% to close at 34,915.8.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indian equities witnessed their best quarter since 2009 after Tuesdays market close, on the last day of June. During the days session, the indices gave up their gains in the last hour of trade, tracking global cues. Uncertainties around the lockdown and rising Covid-19 cases also dampened investor mood. The benchmark Sensex was down by 45.72 points or 0.13% to close at 34,915.8. The 50-share index Nifty was down by 10.30 points or 0.1% to close at 10,302.1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June, both Sensex and Nifty have rallied by 7.69% and 7.84%, in dollar terms, respectively, which is part of the best-ever quarter in 11 years. This makes them the best-performing benchmark indices in Asia for the month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sanjeev Hota, head of research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, The last time the markets saw such a decline was during 2009 following which we witnessed a great quarter. This time it is the same too, it simply means that the markets have bounced back from the lows. We have moved up quite a bit from the bottom of 7,600 in March but the rally cannot be one way till the time we see concrete signs of improvement on the earnings and macro front. So, investors should be ready for some healthy correction going ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nifty touched a low point of 10,267.35. This is after the European markets started showing weakness in trade with the stock market in the UK down by 0.4%. On the other hand, the stock markets in France and Germany were up between 0.08% to 0.3% at the time of press. Deepak Jasani, head- retail research, HDFC Securities, said, European stocks fluctuated in early trade on Tuesday, with banks and energy firms leading the losses at the end of a strong quarter, while UK markets took a hit from a worse-than-expected GDP reading. The UK economy also suffered its sharpest slump in more than 40 years as gross domestic product fell 2.2% between January and March.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Dow Jones Mini futures were flat, up by 26.5 points at the time of press. Asian markets extended the gains of the previous trading session of the US markets, which were up as investors continued to focus on economies reopening in spite of the rising Covid toll in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Foreign portfolio investors have continued to remain buyers in the Indian equity markets pumping as much as $2.73 billion, the highest since the equity outflow in March where they pulled out $8.3 billion from the markets. They remained sellers throughout April and were buyers in May because of the block deal that took place in marquee companies such as&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HUL. The volumes in the futures and options segment on Tuesday stood at Rs 10.79 lakh crore against the six-month average of Rs 13.9 lakh crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The biggest gainers on Nifty were Shree Cement, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, Nestle India and Britannia Industries  up by 3.12%, 2.66%, 2.59%, 2.54%, and 2.41%. The biggest losers on Nifty were BPCL, PowerGrid Corp, Sun Pharmaceuticals, GAIL, and IOC  down by 2.5%, 1.94%, 1.89%, 1.88%, and 1.72%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the broader market, the Nifty Smallcap and Nifty Midcap were down by 0.21% and 0.61%. Sectorally, the biggest loser was Nifty PSU Bank, followed by Nifty Media, Nifty Pharma, and&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nifty IT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Dem climate plan would end greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</title>
            <link>https://in.news.yahoo.com/dem-climate-plan-end-greenhouse-154515771.html</link>
            <description> View photos More WASHINGTON (AP)  House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a plan to address climate change that would set a&#60;p&#62;goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while pushing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and addressing environmental contamination that disproportionately harms low-income and minority communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The election-year plan backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders is less ambitious than a sweeping Green New Deal that a group of progressive Democrats outlined last year to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Green New Deal, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calls for dramatic steps to virtually eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 with a goal of meeting 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources, including nuclear power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The new plan, put forth Tuesday in a 538-page report, offers similar goals but at a slower pace. It sets a range of targets, including a 45% reduction by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The plan also would require that by 2035 new cars emit no greenhouse gases, while heavy-duty trucks would eliminate those emissions by 2040. The plan would eliminate overall emissions from the power sector by 2040 and all but eliminate greenhouse emissions from all economic sectors by 2050.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Supporters say the plan, presented by Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, by 2050 would save more than 60,000 American lives every year thanks to reduced air pollution, as well as nearly $8 trillion thanks to health and climate benefits.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Democrats know the climate crisis is the essential crisis of our time, threatening public health, jobs and the economy, national security and values,'' Pelosi said Tuesday at a Capitol news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are here today to provide hope and vision,'' said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chairwoman of the climate panel. She called the Democratic plan a "transformative road map for solving the climate crisis,'' and pledged it would address environmental justice and vulnerable communities that are suffering from the effects of air and water pollution and industrial waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The health of our families and the air we breathe are at the heart of our plan,'' Castor said, adding that it would create good-paying jobs in solar and wind energy, manufacturing electric vehicles and ensuring that communities are more resilient to flooding, extreme heat, intense hurricanes and wildfires.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While likely to win approval in the Democratic-controlled House, the plan faces insurmountable opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats are hoping to make inaction on climate change by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration a key campaign issue in November's election.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Republicans immediately slammed the plan as a job-killer. The Democratic plan punishes the American economy and gives a free pass to China to pollute, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; White House spokesman Judd Deere said President Donald Trump has expanded responsible, clean-energy technologies "while the Democrats continue to push radical Green New Deal-like polices that would cripple America's economy and crush the poorest communities across the globe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Democratic plan is similar to one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Biden's plan also sets a goal for net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and pledges an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than 2025.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A Biden spokesman applauded Pelosi and House Democrats and said that as president, Biden will work with Congress to implement a bold agenda that addresses the climate emergency, achieves environmental justice and creates good-paying jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The new plan received immediate support from more than 90 outside organizations, including major environmental groups and leaders in environmental justice, agriculture, public health and transportation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Sunrise Movement, a progressive group that helped develop the Green New Deal, said the plan did not go far enough, fast enough to halt climate change.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "This plan is more ambitious than anything we have seen from Democratic leadership so far, but it still needs to go further to match the full scale of the crisis,'' said Lauren Maunus, the group's legislative manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There's nothing to lose by going bigger,'' Maunus said. "Taking action at the scale of the crisis will help lift our economy out of recession and put millions of people back to work building a more just and resilient society.''&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a sign of the changed political environment, the Democratic plan heavily emphasizes environmental justice and notes that the report's release comes as the nation is reeling from a cascade of crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. which has killed more than 120,000 Americans; stay-at-home orders and business closures that have put 40 million Americans out of work; and nationwide protests in response to the police killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Throughout these crises, Trump has "failed to lead the country in a unified and compassionate response, instead choosing to fan the flames of discord and distrust,'' the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, lead author of a 2018 report on climate change for the United Nations, said the House committee's report got the science correct. If you want to keep temperatures low, we need to act quickly. The emission cuts required are really quite dramatic, as they say here, Mahowald said in an email.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann called the report an excellent starting point that offers a sensible mix of subsidies for renewable energy and a price on carbon emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The report was released as the Trump administration pushed a plan to spur production of fossil fuels even higher. In a 56-page report that did not mention the word "climate,'' the Energy Department on Tuesday urged building up four Appalachian states as a petrochemical production and manufacturing hub, while delaying market-driven retirements of the region's coal plants. The four targeted states  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky  are the heart of Appalachian energy production. Pennsylvania is a key battleground in the 2020 election, and recent polls show Biden narrowly leading Trump in Ohio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Trump has mocked the science of climate change, and his administration has dismantled Obama-era initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while throwing a series of financial and regulatory breaks to the coal, oil and gas sectors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ___&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this story.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/kashmir/mining-contracts-to-outsiders-will-rob-locals-of-job-opportunities-nc/</link>
            <description> National Conference on Tuesday expressed concern over allotment of mining contracts on river Jhelum and its tributaries to non-locals, saying it will rob local youth of job opportunities and affect livelihood of thousands of families.&#60;p&#62;In a statement, the party MPs Muhammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi while expressing concern over the discriminatory measures said last year the rights for extraction of the minerals was exclusively reserved for local contractors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Due to the restrictions on the internet, the local contractors couldnt participate in the on-line bidding process. From contractors to manual sand diggers, laborers to transporters, and scores of other mineral workers who are directly or indirectly associated with the extraction of minerals, all will be in peril because local contractors failed to participate in the bid as internet was not available to them. Whatever little they earn to manage their household chores comes from the sand mining, the MPs said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They said educated youth of J&#38;K were already suffering due to shrinking employment opportunities aggravated by measures taken on the August 5 last year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They said the domicile policy has added to the frustration of youth on account of diminishing job avenues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Unavailability of a viable private sector and the ruin caused to local hospitality, handicraft and manufacturing sectors post August 5 and successive COVID19 induced lockdown has increased the trepidation of the unemployed youth of J&#38;K, the MPs said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They said all 10 mineral blocks in river Jhelum in Srinagar have gone to outsiders; in north Kashmirs Baramulla, 26 sand mining contracts of 38 mineral blocks have gone to outsiders, and in central Kashmirs Budgam district, of seven mineral blocks, four have been awarded to outsiders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is all what New Delhi has for Kashmir; every single step of there is pushing hapless Kashmiri youth towards a chasm, they said, adding there has been no let up in New Delhis repugnance for rights of Kashmiri people especially the youth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Mps urged the government to put the new mining and extraction policy in abeyance and allow locals to draw their sustenance from it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the Mps urged the J&#38;K government to grant six months extension to all PhD and Integrated PhD scholars whose residency period ends this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They couldnt do any work during the post August lockdown and subsequent COVID19 induced crises. Kashmir University administration is ambiguous about the fate of scholars. The University should come up with a clear policy on the graduate level exams; PG levels exams and other entrance tests, said the MPs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Solar equipment imports from China may soon come under double taxation</title>
            <link>http://www.climatesamurai.com/solar/solar-equipment-imports-from-china-may-soon-come-under-double-taxation/</link>
            <description> Solar equipment imports, largely from countries such as China, may soon come under double taxation with the Director General of Trade Remedies ( DGTR ) looking&#60;p&#62;to consider continued imposition of 15 per cent safeguard duty (SGD) on imports of solar cells and modules beyond the cutoff date of July 29.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The DGTR is scheduled to do oral hearing on extension of SGD on July 3 through video conferencing. If a decision to extend safeguard duty is taken then solar equipment imports from August onwards faces the prospect of double taxation. The power ministry has already said that upto 20-25 per cent basic customs duty is going to be imposed on solar modules and 15-20 per cent on cells.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;DGTRs oral hearing was previously scheduled be held on June 11, 2020, but was postponed due to certain administrative exigencies. Now, the hearing in first week of July will clear the way whether safeguard duty gets extended.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The safeguard duty was imposed starting from July 30, 2018 for a period of two years to protect the domestic industry against dumping of cheap equipment, especially from countries like China that commands over 80 per cent of India s market for solar gear. The duty was set at 25 per cent for the first year, followed by a phased down approach for the second year, with the rate reduced by 5 per cent every six months until it ends in July, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With safeguard duty scheduled to end, power ministry proposed a 20-25 per cent basic customs duty on solar module imports for the current year that will go upto 40 per cent level in the next year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, the duty on solar cells has been proposed at a lower 15 per cent level for the first year and a higher 30-40 per cent level in the next year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If both safeguard and customs duty on solar gear imports go concurrently then the sector will face heavy duty load of close to 50 per cent including cesses and surcharge.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This would kill the solar industry in India that is still largely based on imports as there are issues about domestic capacity and concerns on quality, said a solar power producer asking not to be named.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He added that such a situation may not arise as such high levels of taxation and import restrictions may not be permitted under international trade agreements.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But government sources said that duty levels could go up as both basic customs duty and safeguard duty are WTO compatible. He however added that if safeguard duty was extended then customs duty plan may be postponed for now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Mercom, the DGTR held a review investigation in March 2020 to see if there was a need to extend the safeguard duty beyond its deadline following an application filed by the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA). They sought for the duty to be extended by another four years. The domestic manufacturers filing the petition had provided import data released by the Department of Commerce from 2014-15 to 2019-20 (up to September 2019) for this investigation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The domestic solar module manufacturers have also stated that the policy (SGD) had failed to achieve the desired objectives of protecting domestic manufacturers from a sudden surge of imports since the safeguard duty was imposed for only two years, and the implementation period of utility-scale solar projects is 18 to 24 months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mercom said that in May, the DGTR extended the deadline for filing responses to a questionnaire investigating the continued imposition of the duty because of the nationwide lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: IANS&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The commerce ministry's investigation arm DGTR taking probe for continued imposition of safeguard duty on solar cell imports forward has called concerned parties for oral hearing on Friday. In March this year, an application for review and extension of safeguard duty has been filed by Mundra Solar PV, Jupiter Solar&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Solar"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Indian government proposes to end custom duty exemption on solar cells and module imports as it looks to boost domestic manufacturing and put a check on large scale procurement of solar generation equipment from China. Sources in the government said that a 20 per cent basic customs duty may&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Solar"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Domestic solar cell and module makers located at the special economic zones (SEZs) have raised concerns over the government's plan to impose basic customs duty (BCD) on these equipment, saying it would raise their overall product cost on domestic sales. Noting that the domestic renewable energy sector has potential to&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Solar"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in its new report identify how COVID-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors.&#60;p&#62;The report recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the countrys leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for Indias transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new report, titled Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities for Indias Energy and Mobility Sectors, advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said that he is confident that Indias economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indias strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the countrys growth rate ahead of peers, he said. Clean energy will be a major driver of Indias economic recovery and international competitiveness, added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses-the transport and power sectors-and emerge stronger.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programs to support Indias clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities, said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to Indias public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India, said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyones lives, said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report states that Indias transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand. The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, is the premier policy think tank of the Government of India, providing both directional and policy inputs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While designing strategic and long-term policies and programs for the Government of India, NITI Aayog also provides relevant technical advice to the centre and states. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring states to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters cooperative federalism.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;About Rocky Mountain Institute Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)-an independent nonprofit founded in 1982-transforms global energy use to create a clean, prosperous, and secure low-carbon future. It engages businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rocky Mountain Institute published India Leaps Ahead: Transformative Mobility Solutions for All with NITI Aayog in May 2017, and works with central government agencies like NITI Aayog, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and Department of Heavy Industries to support Indias transition to clean, shared, and connected mobility.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Enter your email address&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sign Up&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India has moved up two positions to rank 74th on a global 'Energy Transition Index'with improvements on all key parameters of economic growth, energy security and environmental sustainability, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said on Wednesday. Releasing the annual rankings, the Geneva-based international organisation for public-private cooperation said COVID-19&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Hydro &#38; Biofules"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indias renewable energy subsidies fell 35% from FY17 to FY19, while its oil and gas subsidies increased by 65% according to a new study entitled Mapping Indias Energy Subsidies 2020, released by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). How the government tackles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Solar"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amid a push for electric vehicles, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan Friday said India will continue to rely on petrol and diesel for running automobiles and will need to expand its oil refining capacity by 80 per cent to meet the demand for the fuel in near future. "EV is a&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In "Electric Vehicles"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Hedge Funds Getting Bullish On Allot Ltd. (ALLT)</title>
            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-getting-bullish-allot-150732921.html</link>
            <description> The latest 13F reporting period has come and gone, and Insider Monkey have plowed through 821 13F filings that hedge funds and well-known value investors are required to file by the SEC.&#60;p&#62;The 13F filings show the funds' and investors' portfolio positions as of March 31st, a week after the market trough. Now, we are almost done with the second quarter. Investors decided to bet on the economic recovery and a stock market rebound. S&#38;P 500 Index returned almost 20% this quarter. In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds thoughtAllot Ltd. (NASDAQ: ALLT ) was a good investment heading into the second quarter and how the stock traded in comparison to the top hedge fund picks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ: ALLT was in 13 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2020. ALLT investors should be aware of an increase in hedge fund sentiment in recent months. There were 10 hedge funds in our database with ALLT holdings at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that ALLT isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's monthly stock picks returned 101% since March 2017 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETFs by more than 58 percentage points. Our short strategy outperformed the S&#38;P 500 short ETFs by 20 percentage points annually ( see the details here ). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [caption id="attachment_27209" align="aligncenter" width="400"] Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies[/caption]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one . We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. For example we are checking out stocks recommended/scorned by legendary Bill Miller . Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&#38;P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to view the recent hedge fund action regarding Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ: ALLT&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What does smart money think about Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT)?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Q1's end, a total of 13 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 30% from the fourth quarter of 2019. By comparison, 10 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in ALLT a year ago. With hedgies' capital changing hands, there exists an "upper tier" of key hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes significantly (or already accumulated large positions).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Among these funds, Lynrock Lake held the most valuable stake in Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT), which was worth $62 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was Renaissance Technologies which amassed $18.9 million worth of shares. Sphera Global Healthcare Fund, Rima Senvest Management, and P.A.W. CAPITAL PARTNERS were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Lynrock Lake allocated the biggest weight to Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT), around 6.11% of its 13F portfolio. P.A.W. CAPITAL PARTNERS is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 4.77 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ALLT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As industrywide interest jumped, key money managers have been driving this bullishness. Sphera Global Healthcare Fund , managed by Doron Breen and Mori Arkin, initiated the most outsized position in Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT). Sphera Global Healthcare Fund had $8.7 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Josh Goldberg's G2 Investment Partners Management also made a $3.5 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with brand new ALLT positions are Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP and Greg Eisner's Engineers Gate Manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT). We will take a look at Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CNSL ), Camtek LTD. (NASDAQ: CAMT ), WAVE Life Sciences Ltd. (NASDAQ: WVE ), and Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ: CENX ). This group of stocks' market valuations are similar to ALLT's market valuation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position CNSL,15,16767,-1 CAMT,6,21349,-3 WVE,10,114425,-3 CENX,12,13347,-1 Average,10.75,41472,-2 [/table]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; View table here if you experience formatting issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As you can see these stocks had an average of 10.75 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $41 million. That figure was $107 million in ALLT's case. Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CNSL ) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Camtek LTD. (NASDAQ: CAMT ) is the least popular one with only 6 bullish hedge fund positions. Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ:ALLT) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.4% in 2019 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks gained 13.3% in 2020 through June 25th but beat the market by 16.8 percentage points. Unfortunately ALLT wasn't nearly as popular as these 10 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on ALLT were disappointed as the stock returned 13.4% during the same time period and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds as many of these stocks already outperformed the market so far this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [company-follow-email id=1365767][/company-follow-email]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Disclosure: None.

            <title>UPDATE 1-Occidental Petroleum extends bid deadline for Wyoming, Colorado land</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/occidental-deals-wyoming/update-1-occidental-petroleum-extends-bid-deadline-for-wyoming-colorado-land-idINL1N2E72ZD</link>
            <description> 2 Min Read (Adds detail, background) June 30 (Reuters) - Troubled Occidental Petroleum Corp has given the state of Wyoming until&#60;p&#62;July 8 to bid on the land and minerals it is selling in Wyoming and Colorado, the Wyoming governor's office said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company has been struggling with debt taken on in last year's $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market crash.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Wyoming's State Loan and Investment Board will hold a public hearing before deciding if it will bid on the properties, a spokesman for the governor said on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Occidental's initial deadline to submit bids was Wednesday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Occidental acquired the land and minerals with its 2019 purchase of Anadarko. It is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It hoped at one point to fetch as much as $700 million in the sale, according to people familiar with the offering.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Occidental received 13 bids in the first round of its sales process, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub told analysts during a May 6 earnings call, adding the company expected to be able to close on that asset late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.

            <title>Allotment of mineral extraction contracts to outsiders will affect locals: NC</title>
            <link>https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/allotment-of-mineral-extraction-contracts-to-outsiders-will-affect-locals-nc/</link>
            <description> SRINAGAR, June 30: Jammu and Kashmir National Conference today expressed concern over allotment of sand mining and mineral extraction contracts to non residents of J&#38;K saying the measure will rob employment opportunities from our youth and affect livelihood of thousands of families.&#60;p&#62;In a statement Partys Members of Parliament Muhammad Akbar Lone and Justice (Retd) Hasnain Masoodi while expressing concern over the discriminatory measures said last year the rights for extraction of the minerals was exclusively reserved for local contractors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Due to the restrictions on the internet, the local contractors couldnt participate in the online bidding process. From contractors to manual sand diggers, laborers to transporters, and scores of other mineral workers who are directly or indirectly associated with the extraction of minerals, all will be in peril because local contractors failed to bid for the contract as the internet was not available to them. Whatever little they earn to manage their household chores comes from the sand mining, the duo said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All the 10 mineral blocks in river Jhelum in Srinagar have gone to outsiders; in north Kashmirs Baramulla, 26 sand mining contracts out of 38 mineral blocks have gone to outsiders, and in central Kashmirs Budgam district, of seven mineral blocks, four have been awarded to outsiders in the bidding process, they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Members of Parliament urged the Government to put the new mining or extraction policy in abeyance and allow the locals to draw their sustenance from it. The first claim on local resources rightfully belongs to local people, they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the duo also urged the J&#38;K Government to grant a six months extension to all PhD and Integrated PhD scholars whose residency period ends this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>NASA Names Joel Montalbano International Space Station Program Manager</title>
            <link>http://www.itnewsonline.com/prnewswire/NASA-Names-Joel-Montalbano-International-Space-Station-Program-Manager/698573</link>
            <description> WASHINGTON, June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Kathy Lueders, NASA's associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations, has named Joel Montalbano as manager of the International Space Station Program. The appointment was effective&#60;p&#62;June 29 following the June 26 retirement of Kirk Shireman, who held the position since 2015.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Joel has the experience and leadership we need to guide the station program during this exciting and dynamic time of human spaceflight," said Lueders. "We look forward to seeing Joel continue to make great contributions to the International Space Station and know he'll do a great job leading the program."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Montalbano had served as deputy program manager for NASA's space station program since 2012, a role in which he shared responsibility with the program manager for day-to-day management, working across organizations and with NASA centers, other government agencies, and partners to ensure seamless and efficient space station integration. He led integration and definition of projects to use the unique microgravity laboratory in space to lay the groundwork for future explorers, such as the Artemis program astronauts who will include the first woman and next man to land on the Moon in 2024.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;His efforts also helped expand scientific research, engineering technology development, and human mission operations. He has fostered the use of the station as a National Laboratory with projects that support national, agency, and program goals for scientific, technological, diplomatic, and educational purposes and which are enabling commercial activities in low-Earth orbit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The International Space Station has allowed us to accelerate the power of a space economy in low-Earth orbit throughout the past 20 years," said Mark Geyer, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, which is home to the space station program office. "Joel brings a wealth of knowledge to this new role, and I know the program will continue to thrive under his leadership."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prior to becoming deputy program manager, Montalbano was the director of NASA's Human Space Flight Program in Russia from 2008 to 2012. He was a NASA flight director from 2000 to 2008. Montalbano began his career at Rockwell in June 1988 and became a NASA civil servant in August 1998. He earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"It is an honor to be named as the International Space Station Program Manager," Montalbano said. "I'm looking forward to continuing our work with our domestic and international partners on this world-class laboratory. We are approaching the anniversary of 20 years of a continuous U.S. presence on the station, and it is clear to me that even greater accomplishments lie ahead in this global effort for the benefit of all humanity and the pathway to future human exploration."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Throughout his career, Montalbano has earned multiple NASA awards, including the Distinguished Service Medal in 2018. He received NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 2003 and 2007, Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2004, and the Superior Accomplishment Award in 2007. He also was awarded the Astronauts'Silver Snoopy Award and the American Astronomical Society's Advancement of International Cooperation Award. In 2012, he was awarded Rank of Meritorious Executive, conferred by the president of the United States. Montalbano also was an Eagle Scout.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For almost 20 years, humans have lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, advancing scientific knowledge and demonstrating new technologies, making research breakthroughs not possible on Earth that will enable long-duration human and robotic exploration into deep space. Under this unique international partnership, 239 people from 19 countries have visited the station, which has hosted more than 2,800 research investigations from researchers in 108 countries and areas.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Learn more about the International Space Station at:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;https://www.nasa.gov/station&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SOURCE NASA&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF), a new climate fund backed by philanthropic donors, is seeking to mobilise $2.5 billion of private investments for clean energy projects in Southeast Asia.&#60;p&#62;The fund, which is managed by Singapore-based Clime Capital, will initially focus on renewable energy projects in Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, according to a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It will offer high-risk venture capital-type funding initiative to fill a gap in financing early-stage clean energy projects in the region.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SEACEF has an initial investment of $10 million from supporting global philanthropies and is seeking to attract up to $40 million in additional capital.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among its supporters are international climate foundations such as Sea Change Foundation International, Wellspring Climate Initiative, High Tide Foundation, Grantham Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Packard Foundation, and Childrens Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Imraam Mohammed, head of impact investing at CIFF, said the launch of SEACEF comes at a time when the COVID-19 crisis is shrinking traditional sources of funding.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Impact investors and Foundations are stepping up to bridge the gap, catalyse other sources of funding, and ensure the transition to clean energy in Southeast Asia continues to accelerate, Mohammed said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Countries in Southeast Asia have set a target of securing 23 per cent of their primary energy from renewable sources by 2025 as demand for energy in the region is forecast to rise by 50 per cent due to rising urbanisation, population, and economic growth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SEACEFs early-stage funding will focus on solar, wind, and energy storage, and other business models that accelerate low carbon transition, such as electric mobility, demand-side management technology, energy efficiency in buildings, and clean energy transmission infrastructure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Development finance for clean energy project was the hardest to find, even before COVID-19, because it carries the highest risk, according to Mason Wallick, managing director at Clime Capital.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the opportunities for renewable energy investment remain significant, so this high-risk capital is a cornerstone at a time of great uncertainty, which can catalyse the significant funding required to turn proposals into major clean energy projects, he stressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Clean energy investments have attracted investors globally. In China, China Life Insurance has teamed up with State Power Investment Corporation to launch a $1.1 billion clean energy fund that will invest in state-backed clean energy projects in underdeveloped regions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Australian government-backed renewable investor Clean Energy Finance Corporation also committed up to $70 million last year to invest in clean energy via a joint venture fund with infrastructure-focused Ironstone Capital.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), one of Australias largest investment managers, announced in February that it has invested in San Francisco-based Generate Capital, the clean energy infrastructure investor, which raised $1 billion in new funding to expand its renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure fleet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

He earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Iowa State University , in Ames, Iowa&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "It is an honor to be named as the International Space Station Program Manager," Montalbano said. "I'm looking forward to continuing our work with our domestic and international partners on this world-class laboratory. We are approaching the anniversary of 20 years of a continuous U.S. presence on the station, and it is clear to me that even greater accomplishments lie ahead in this global effort for the benefit of all humanity and the pathway to future human exploration."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Throughout his career, Montalbano has earned multiple NASA awards, including the Distinguished Service Medal in 2018. He received NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 2003 and 2007, Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2004, and the Superior Accomplishment Award in 2007. He also was awarded the Astronauts' Silver Snoopy Award and the American Astronomical Society's Advancement of International Cooperation Award. In 2012, he was awarded Rank of Meritorious Executive, conferred by the president of the United States .

            <description> Slide 1 of 32: On June 24, auto industry review site J.D. Power released its annual Initial Quality Study (IQS) for 2020.&#60;p&#62;The survey, which measures the number of reported problems new vehicle owners experience within the first three months of ownership, found that owners of a 2020 model experienced an average of 166 problems per 100 vehicles in that time frame. However, individual brands ranged from 136 to over 220 problems per 100 new vehicles. It should be noted that J.D. Power redesigned their survey this year, so all automakers saw an increase in the number of problems reported. We listed all 31 brands ranked from the fewest reported problems to the most. Quarterly U.S. sales figures data came from goodcarbadcar.net, an aggregator of auto sales figures. The IQS is based on a survey of 87,282 purchasers and lessees of new 2020 model year cars. In general, American brands scored better than the industry average, while a number of European brands had among the highest rates of reported problems. Somewhat surprisingly, luxury brands were more likely to have problems because they come equipped with complex technology that is more prone to malfunction, according to J.D. Power. Infotainment technology, J.D. Power said, was the most likely category to give rise to complaints. Tesla was included in the study for the first time and had more reported problems per 100 vehicles than the worst-ranked brand on the list. However, J.D. Power cautioned that the electric car maker's score should not be compared to others because it didn't provide data for some states.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On June 24, auto industry review site J.D.

            <title>Pantum Wins Bid to Supply Printers and Ensures After-Sales Services for Mahanadi Coalfields Limited</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111134-pantum-wins-bid-to-supply-printers-and-ensures-after-sales-services-for-mahanadi-coalfields-limited</link>
            <description> ZHUHAI, China, June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a successful bid, Pantum provided printers to Coal India Limited's Odisha arm Mahanadi Coalfields Limited&#60;p&#62;(MCL) and has continuously provided on-site after-sales services, helping solve diverse usage problems, even during the pandemic. As one of Coal India Limited's eight subsidiaries, MCL is a major coal producer in the country. Given the significant activity of its mining zones, at least 1,000 trucks move through the area every day. Vehicle passes must be printed for these trucks, in addition to daily office needs. Therefore, MCL required printers with high requirements for machine performance and monthly load. Moreover, automatic duplex printing and printing speeds of 30+ PPM (pages per minute) would deliver tremendous efficiency and value for such a busy company.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Given their specific needs, Pantum supplied MCL with the P3500DN printer because of easy connectivity, energy-saving features, compact footprint and more. With an all-metal structure that ensures stable printing, the machine is suitable for large-scale production sites. Powered with a maximum monthly print volume of 80,000 pages, the P3500DN can easily help customers who always need to handle large print jobs. Also armed with automatic duplexing function instead of scanning both sides of a two-sided page in one pass, the P3500DN can quickly print 33 pages per minute (A4) and 35 pages per minute (letter). Moreover, in order to be more convenient for the business, the built-in Ethernet network interface allows multiple computers to print from the same printer. The P3500DN also has a built-in paper tray that holds 250 sheets and two external trays that hold 550 sheets each to double or even triple printing experience, with a total paper capacity of 1,350 sheets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MCL commented on the cooperation with Pantum, "We are very satisfied with the Pantum&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;P3500DN printer. The printers are stable, durable, and quiet, with a low paper jam rate. In fact, We've placed an order for more than 700 new toner cartridges." To best serve the Indian market, Pantum has always designed its printers that deliver high efficiency, convenience, durability and high-cost performance. More importantly, Pantum takes pride in its exceptional after-sales services and prioritizes providing a seamless, rich customer service experience as part of its brand commitment to its Indian customers.

            <description> Constantly sharing updates of user views on Twitter, Chingari developer, Sumit Ghosh, claimed 300,000 downloads were being recorded per hour on the application.&#60;p&#62;Chingari, one of the rivals to hugely popular TikTok, has shown increased user views and now stands at over one million downloads. Introducing the app as, "India ka naya TV, by the people, for the people" it boasts of local connect of its founders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Videos uploaded are similar to TikTok - short-duration and inspired by Bollywood songs. However, there are mixed reviews about its quality as compared to the original Chinese application.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Constantly sharing updates of user views on Twitter, Chingari developer, Sumit Ghosh, claimed 300,000 downloads were being recorded per hour on the application.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IITian Sharad Shankar made an application LightX Photo Editor in 2018. This India-built app, LightX Photo Editor, competes with now banned Chinese apps Meitu.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Chinese apps flooded the Indian market in 2014-2015 and it was tough to compete. So this decision by the government is a good decision, for our benefit," said Shankar.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prashant Kumar, co-founder, AndOr Communications added, "We don't have Chinese investment in our company, everything is made in India. This will give an opportunity to Indians to capture their market. China had a strong hold over us. Now things will change."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Apps like Roposo are being aimed at Indians looking for a fun social media platform to interact. With Helo banned, Indian app Sharechat now has 100 million users. LightX photo Editor has garnered 40 million users. With the Chinese shopping site Shein also in the banned list, sites like Myntra and Flipkart are sure to get a big boost too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;READ | After ban, TikTok now stops working in India and shows internet error&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO READ | All apps must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy: Niti Aayog CEO&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO WATCH | Strongly concerned, says China after India bans 59 Chinese apps advertisement&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Decoding the app ban: Growth plans go astray for Chinese firms</title>
            <link>https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/decoding-the-app-ban-growth-plans-go-astray-for-chinese-firms-1695703-2020-07-01</link>
            <description> With their apps losing millions of users in India, parent companies may even see a decline in valuation.&#60;p&#62;The comprehensive ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps leaves the flourishing app economy in a state of disarray in the midst of a heightened sense of nationalism following the India-China standoff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban has wide-ranging implications for companies who own these apps; thousands of employees of these firms, besides an energetic breed of content creators and influencers who practically now suffer a 'career setback'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On a sticky wicket&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Therefore, let's begin with the legality of the ban and if the government has got all aspects covered. According to experts, in terms of legal and constitutional competencies, the government seems to be on a sticky wicket.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;First, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) order issued on Monday doesn't talk about specific evidence of violation in the order. It will have to be brought forward in case the ban is legally challenged, which is very likely.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The order talks about "misuse of some mobile apps on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This issue is particularly tricky because India still doesn't have the Data Protection Act in place which specifically deals with such issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Privacy Question&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, on the issue of privacy concerns raised in the MeitY order, there are no laws that specifically deal with it unless the government intends to refer to the 2017 order of the Supreme Court on the right to privacy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"There are no proper laws in areas like data protection and privacy. To implement cyber laws, there's no specific regulator. It's under everybody's jurisdiction, be it police, NITI Aayog, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), home ministry, and others," says Virag Gupta, a cyber lawyer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;advertisement&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chinese Investments&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While the legality of the ban will take its time to unfold, what will be the immediate impact of the ban on the companies who own these apps, and Chinese investment in India?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban on these apps will not only impact the popularity of these apps but also the valuation of their parent companies. For instance, TikTok which is one of the most popular apps in India with more than 200 million users, has witnessed 30.3% of its total downloads from this country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The parent company&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ByteDance was also planning to invest $1 billion in India and hire 1,000 people. Additionally there are talks about an IPO for ByteDance that is valued at more than $100 billion. But, in the larger scheme of things, the ban will have very little impact on Chinese investments in India. That is because a lot of Indian startups operate on funds from big Chinese investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to a report by thinktank Gateway House, as many as 18 of the 30 unicorns in India are backed by Chinese investors. Tech titans, the BAT companies - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - as they are called in China, are also a significant part of these investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Paytm, Zomato, Byju's, Ola, Flipkart, Swiggy, OYO, Delhivery, Practo, Rivigo, MakeMyTrip, Big-Basket, Hike are some of the big home-grown companies to have Chinese investments. There are many others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Big Losers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Beyond the companies who own these apps, the worst hit due to the ban is the influencer community on TikTok. Influencers who were born on TikTok and didn't expand their presence across other social media platforms are likely to be hurt the most.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, those who had a presence across Instagram, YouTube amongst others, will be able to channelise their campaigns and continue to earn.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Content creators will also face monetary losses since brands have already started putting their planned TikTok activities in pause mode for now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The platform was used for influencer engagement. Given the massive fan following most influencers enjoyed, brands were engaging with them directly for promotion. I see those rates dropping down significantly now," says Nimesh Shah, Head Maven, Windchimes Communications.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Industry experts believe that while there are no clear guidelines or clarity on the current situation, brands should quickly complete planned commitments with an additional post on linked channels such as Instagram.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once the platform is not accessible, all the scheduled campaigns from the brands will be on pause until further clarity from the government.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;READ | After ban, TikTok now stops working in India and shows internet error&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO READ | All apps must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy: Niti Aayog CEO&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ALSO WATCH | Strongly concerned, says China after India bans 59 Chinese apps&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>India has to be data sovereign country, apps should adhere to data integrity: NITI Aayog CEO</title>
            <link>https://www.newkerala.com/news/2020/116398.htm</link>
            <description> New Delhi, June 30: A day after the Centre banned 59 mobile apps with China links, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that any apps released in the country must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency and stressed that the country has to stay "data sovereign".&#60;p&#62;"All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency. They must be transparent in origin and final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amid the ongoing border tensions with China in Eastern Ladakh, the Centre had on Monday banned 59 mobile apps including Tik Tok, UC Browser and other Chinese apps "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity and defence" of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A senior official at the IT Ministry said the prime reason to block the apps under section 69 A of Information Technology Act is to stop the violation and threat to the security of the state and public order and to plug the data leaks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Almost all of them have some preferential Chinese interest. Few are from countries like Singapore. However, the majority have parent companies which are Chinese," the official said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure the safety and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace, Ministry of Information Technology said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/60-new-cases-seraikela-records-biggest-spike/articleshow/76718671.cms</link>
            <description> Ranchi: As many as 60 positive cases of Covid 19 infections were detected in 10 districts of Jharkhand on Tuesday. Along with the four cases detected late on Monday night, the states virus caseload rose to 2,490, of which 591 are active, 1,884 have recovered (including 35 on Tuesday) while 15 patients have died.&#60;p&#62;With 25 new cases, Seraikela-Kharsawan district recorded its biggest single-day spike in new. Dhanbad recorded 14 cases, East Singhbhum 11, Sahibganj three, Deoghar two and Ranchi, Ramgarh and Dumka one each. Of the new infections detected, 24 are migrants. In all, 1,974 migrants have been tested positive so far in the state.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;East Singhbhum district, which was Covid-free till the second week of May, now has the most number of infections in Jharkhand (392). Of all the 566 active cases active statewide, the district also has the highest share of 175 cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dhanbad, East Singhbhum, Giridih, Gumla, Hazaribag, Koderma and Ranchi account for more than 70% of Jharkhands active case load. While Ranchi has 53 active cases, 165 patients have recovered so far. Pakur and Godda, which have one active case each, are headed towards becoming Covid-free again.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) put the Covid-19 tally in Ramgarh at one, the district administration said three CISF jawans, deployed at NTPCs under-construction thermal power plant in Patratu, tested positive for the virus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Deputy commissioner Sandeep Singh said the personnel were at a government quarantine facility in Officers Club in Patratu. Their samples were sent for tests on June 28, Singh said. The jawans had arrived separately from Buxar (Bihar), Gorakhpur (UP) and Andhra Pradesh recently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The cryostats function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts heavy engineering business won the contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts heavy engineering business won the contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) on Tuesday flagged off the final assembly of a cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber to Cadarache in France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Larsen &#38; Toubro has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostats function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts heavy engineering business won the contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the scientific project in 2012. It was conducted in collaboration with seven countries including India and the project outlay is around $20 billion. L&#38;Ts scope of work for the cryostat was to the tune of Rs 1,300 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Explaining the importance of the project, Anil V Parab, executive vice-president and head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering, told FE that this is for the first time that a 500-megawatt reactor has been built which is the commercial demonstration of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Parab said given the sheer size of the project, it was complex. The cryostat that we are making will be the largest vacuum vessel built ever in the world. It is a very complex project. So ensuring that we got all the quality standards and the tolerances with the required specifications right is a big feat for L&#38;T.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In terms of the challenges, Parab said adapting to various international standards was an important challenge. It could not be transported in one piece. It is going in 50 models, which are being assembled into four major assemblies at a workshop that we have set up at Cadarache, France. We have been there in France for almost four years to do this work. Knowing the French labour laws, environmental safety standards were some of the other challenges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, said, This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large scale feasibility of fusion power. mail logo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to FE Daily Newsletter for latest updates on markets, business, money, infra &#38; more, right in your mailbox&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The other company, which despite not being a Tier 3 AEO, has been allowed relaxation is Foxconn, but only for its plant which manufactures phones for Apple.&#60;p&#62;Tier 3 is the highest category and importers make to this grade after long years and distinguished track record.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Tier 3 is the highest category and importers make to this grade after long years and distinguished track record. (Representative image)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A week after the customs authorities clamped down on import consignments coming from China by subjecting them to physical checks reportedly on alerts of some contraband, theres some respite for around 11 companies, which include the likes of LG Electronics, Samsung India, Toyota Kirloskar, Honda Cars, Siemens, and HP India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These firms fall under Tier 3 AEO (authorised economic operators) importers and after the representation of the electronics body, India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the authorities have softened their stand and agreed not to subject their consignments to 100% physical checks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The other company, which despite not being a Tier 3 AEO, has been allowed relaxation is Foxconn, but only for its plant which manufactures phones for Apple. Consignments for its other plant, which manufactures phones for the Chinese firm Xiaomi, have not been granted the relaxation and continue to be stuck at the ports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Out of a total of 3,503 AEOs in the country, only 11 are of Tier 3 category. The AEOs are basically green channel importers who under normal circumstances get clearance automatically without any examination. Importers are categorised as Tier 1, 2 and 3 based on their size and past track record. Tier 3 is the highest category and importers make to this grade after long years and distinguished track record.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The result of this selective approach adopted by the customs authorities has ensured that plants of South Korean majors, LG and Samsung, or Japanese Toyota and Honda or US-based Apples do not suffer, but production has been severely hit of Chinese firms like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, etc. Though the executives of these firms remained tight-lipped, industry sources said that total stoppage of production is not ruled out in their cases within the next few days.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although several industrial sectors have been hit hard due to delays in clearance of import consignments, the biggest pinch is being felt by electronics players  manufacturers of smartphones, tablets and laptops  as they operate on very thin stocks, barely of a few days. Any delay in clearing consignments throws their entire production schedule out of gear.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman, ICEA, The industry is already in very deep distress having lost production of over Rs 40,000 crore and has only recovered to less than 40% of normalcy. We have just begun to limp back to normal after a massive set of losses for three months  and now this. India is at a very crucial moment with the launch of production linked incentive scheme and two other schemes which require a high level of motivation in the headquarters of global and local companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The vendors of automobile manufacturers also source components from China but their inventory levels are of few weeks therefore they do not face any immediate crunch, but if the delay runs into a longer period of time, they too would feel the pinch.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Rajan Wadhera, president of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Inordinate delays in clearance due to congestion at ports could eventually impact manufacturing of vehicles in India. The industry is piecing itself together as growth is limping back. Any further disruption at this juncture is best avoided.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Other engineering sectors like steel etc, source mainly machinery parts from China, where the frequency is maybe twice a year, so they are better placed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;mail logo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to FE Daily Newsletter for latest updates on markets, business, money, infra &#38; more, right in your mailbox&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Another milestone for India as L&#38;T ships major component for ITER</title>
            <link>https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2020/jul/01/another-milestone-for-india-as-lt-ships-major-component-for-iter-2163693.html</link>
            <description> The component, weighing a whopping 650 tonne, will form the top lid of a cryostat equipment that will act as a giant cooler for the reactor.&#60;p&#62;CHENNAI: Amid the industrial sector facing a slump over the Covid crisis, Indian engineers and scientists have crossed a major milestone by completing the construction of an important component of the $25-billion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) being built in Cadarache, southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The component, weighing a whopping 650 tonne, will form the top lid of a cryostat equipment that will act as a giant cooler for the reactor. The flagging off ceremony of the component was held at Hazira port in Gujarat and was live streamed in social media.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, which is among the seven countries funding the ITER programme, is manufacturing the cryostat with the help of L&#38;T. Once completed, this will be the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ITER is one of the most ambitious energy projects where in 35 nations are collaborating to build the worlds largest tokamak, a magnetic fusion device designed to prove the feasibility of nuclear fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Anil Parab, executive vice-president and head of heavy engineering, L&#38;T, told Express that initially the work had been stopped during the first lockdown and special permission was sought to complete the work. We also faced shortages due to the logistics and availability of equipment, he said. L&#38;T has already delivered the base section and lower cylinder of the cryosat in July 2019 and upper cylinder in March 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now, the top lid sector is being shipped in nine parts and it will then be assembled in the workshop in France, said Parab. Stating that the project cost was Rs 1,350 crore, Parab said cryostat is like a giant refrigerator to provide cooling to the reactor and will keep temperatures under control. The first of the large structural-support elements  the 1,250-tonne cryostat base  has been positioned in place and the ITERs massive first-of-a-kind magnets and other components are in final stages and already being shipped to France from other partner countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hydrogen fusion&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fusion reaction, also known as thermo-nuclear reaction, involves fusing of lighter atoms to form a heavier atom. The reaction releases massive amount of energy. Fusion of hydrogen atoms powers the sun and other stars&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>ASL Logistics  Looking at Unswerving Growth</title>
            <link>http://www.motorindiaonline.in/corporate/asl-logistics-looking-at-unswerving-growth/</link>
            <description> in Corporate Logistics by Sarada Vishnu  June 30, 2020 at 12:46 pm |&#60;p&#62;It was 17 years after having founded the Nawany Group that the founder and his brother created the transportation division. What began as an industrial construction project in Mumbai in 1981 later expanded into trading cement and distributing it to major clients, viz., Cement Corporation of India and L&#38;T Cement among others, and thus was born the Groups cement bulker transportation vertical in 1998. Sarada Vishnubhatla puts across questions to Mohit Nawany, Director, ASL Logistics, to find out the Groups insights during Covid-19, strategy and, future roadmap.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nawany Group that was co-founded in 1981 by brothers, Ashok and Vinod, today is a name to reckon with in the cement bulker road transportation. With the able next generation now taking up responsible roles alongside the senior management, Nawany Group is today aiming at growing steadfastly, notwithstanding any dampeners  even if it is in the form of the current pandemic, Covid-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Covid-19 pandemic has, at its worst, wreaked havoc on the countrys economy  akin to its detrimental impact on the global economy. The road transportation segment is no different. The damage has been extensive and the challenges are still being faced despite the signs of slow yet definite revival of the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mohit Nawany, Director, ASL Logistics, shares the general fears plaguing the transportation and logistics sector. Yet he is confident that the revival of the market sentiment is soon to happen: Typically, the robustness of the road transportation sector and the countrys economy work in tandem. Much will depend on the way the road transportation industry recovers and I feel it will mostly be uneven across the sectors. From the cement transportation perspective, we are currently seeing some pre-monsoon pent up demand coming our way. Driver shortage is severe and hence the operating vehicles are doing record-breaking trips. We anticipate that this will taper out in the coming few weeks. In my opinion, the market will return to a certain sense of normalcy by around October 2020. We hope that the virus becomes less destructive by then, but till then I am sure every stakeholder is looking at  first survive and then revive. That is definitely the mantra that we have adopted.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The attrition rate of truck drivers has always been a challenge across the world but more so in India because of lack of skilled drivers, de-humanized treatment that they are meted out with in general and children of truckers unwilling to become drivers. Covid-19 situation has further worsened the communitys prospects  financially, morally and physically, although ASL Logistics continues to fight hard to keep their drivers happy, healthy and well-provided for in these tough times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nawany recounts the challenge: Apart from the obvious loss of business implications during the lockdown period, about 20% of our vehicles have stood loaded for 8 weeks at a stretch, which has led to damages of a different kind, including loss to the vehicle tyres and such. Then, as the operations slowly resumed in the last few weeks, restricted movement of workforce is creating problems. Attending to highway breakdowns has become a major challenge. Our drivers, like most of their brethren, have been bogged down by the fear of the virus contamination when on the move, coupled with their family concerns and their safety, non-availability of food due to wayside amenities being shut and their migration back to hometowns.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He explains further: All our drivers are hired on contractual basis. For the entire lockdown duration, ASL has paid them their regular wages. We are fortunate that we did not have even a single case of drivers getting stranded en route during and due to lockdown. All our drivers have managed to reach either their local homes, our workshops or the cement plants within few hours of the lockdown announcement. And those drivers who were staying at our workshops were provided with food and basic amenities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Additional challenges include inflated labour charges which ASL is either compelled to absorb or pass on to their customers and the sector being non-conducive to the adoption of digital and social media in operations. While the former challenge may see some mitigation what with reverse migration being hinted at, the latter poses a problem of a different nature.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nawany explains: Since this is a B-2-B nature of operation, we have not seen much adoption of digital and social media in our operations. However, we are trying to work closely with all of our clients to incorporate the benefits of technology in changing times. We are constantly pushing them towards e-PODs, freight billing through the system and the like, in an attempt to minimize human interaction and promote paperless transactions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Despite challenges, Nawany is bullish that in a years time, Indias economy will be back on track and well on the road to becoming robust once again.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Nawany Group feels grateful that their loyal team has stood by them in these tough times. He shares: The situation is unprecedented and so are the challenges that we are facing. We are thankful that it has awakened a hero in each one of us and hence there can be not just one particular story to recount. Our workforce  be it young men or those in mid-50s  have risen to the occasion. Almost all our supervisors made it a point to report back as the transportation was resumed. Most of us have gracefully accepted salary cuts and our drivers are doing an amazing job despite fears.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He continues: We have taken up counselling our employees and are providing health insurance of 1 lakh against the pandemic. Currently, we are operating at 50% capacity and we are sure it will only improve from here.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With many major and mid-level global companies planning to shift their manufacturing bases from China to India  a sentiment which seems to have further solidified during Covid-19 pandemic  India surely will see better business days to come. Yet, Nawany feels we will have to strategize in a way to compete better with smaller yet aggressive markets like Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nawany feels: We surely would attract opportunities yet the scale of such projects reaping returns and benefits will take another 4-5 years organically. I am an ardent believer that the great Indian dream is built on SMEs and jugaad entrepreneurship  be it from an economy or an employment standpoint. If the wave of vocal for local can pick up momentum and stay, then the SMEs backed by the government will become the driving force. This, of course, is subject to our ability to deliver price and quality.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top economies today are advocating localization and India needs to understand this better and take more advantage out of it. And to think that, India logs 30-40% higher logistics cost than the global benchmarked cost.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nawany thinks the key reasons for this are  a) inefficiency due to substandard road conditions and poor working culture, b) high tax structure and, c) inferior condition of truck drivers. He explains further: The first point needs to be urgently attended to and work was going on at a war footing prior to Covid-19. The 28% GST on trucks with diesel still not under the GST is a major factor hiking costs. Driver treatment is abysmal in India, and it needs to be reformed while inculcating formal skills in them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Nawany Group salutes the hardworking truck driver community and is gunning for a robust and steady growth of Indian economy and to the road transportation sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Tech saves the day for India's leading dairy brands as lockdowns become new normal</title>
            <link>https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/tech-saves-the-day-for-indias-leading-dairy-brands-as-lockdowns-become-new-normal/76720718</link>
            <description> Amul brand, along with GCMMFs 18-member unions, touches the lives of 3.6 million farmers across about 18,700 villages of Gujarat&#60;p&#62;When the Centre announced nationwide lockdown in the last week of March to contain the spread of Covid-19, it left several retailers engaged in the supply of essential items nervous.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RS Sodhi, the indefatigable managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, popular by its dairy brand Amul, was not one of them, though. There will not be any problem, he declared with an air of confidence, back then. And, he walked, or is still walking the talk as the lockdown has stretched beyond three-weeks, and parts of India, including Mumbai, are still in gridlock.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amul brand, along with GCMMF s 18-member unions, touches the lives of 3.6 million farmers across about 18,700 villages of Gujarat. India's biggest dairy brand with one million-plus retail touchpoints required an infrastructure that can support data-intensive and demanding workloads. The cooperative giants faith and steady investment in the latest technology over the past 10 years has helped it wither the lockdown storm with little or no pain to dairy farmers or consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The dairy giant says its modern servers help in tracking the milk supply chain where any delay in the processing of milk can hurt the quality of the end product. We are probably the largest users of technology in the dairy system in the country. Right from procurement from farmers to touching the customers, it is completely touched by technology, Sodhi told ET.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company invests between Rs 600 crore and Rs 800 crore every year on technology that ensures technology adoption from sourcing milk from farmers; shifting to coolers, chilling the milk, and ensuring that the quality is maintained and then shifting to tankers to reach out to consumers. Technology is adopted in quality, online payment to farmers, and distribution management system for vendors to book orders as well as the adoption of enterprise resource planning software from SAP.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We do more than Rs 50,000 crore business every year, without technology you cannot be in the dairy industry, said Sodhi. The dairy mogul is using IBMs latest servers to run its core operations and deliver milk and dairy products across the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Technology has been helping Amul capture data points from the last Kirana store of the network and analyze varied datasets, IBM India Director (Systems) Viswanath Ramaswamy told ET. This helps the dairy giant to tweak the production of a certain product in sync with the fluctuation in market demand, with ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over a period of time, many smart analytics tools have been added to the technology support infrastructure to effectively manage Amul's supply chain, said Ramaswamy. In the coming years, the cooperatives, like many consumer product companies, will see the use of artificial intelligence in order to make better decisions, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nandini, the second-largest dairy brand after Amul, owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (KMF), is in the process of a technology overhaul. We are going in for the latest ERP technology in KMF and its units, said BC Sateesh, managing director of KMF.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Its member union Bamul in Bengaluru, for example, has adopted Oracle-based ERP. Our district unions have been using their own software, and some are switching to modern ones, he said. Nandini has an annual turnover of about Rs 14,000 crore, and sources milk from about nine lakh farmers across about 254,000 villages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;KMFs Mother Dairy unit in Bengaluru, Sateesh added, has cloud-based ERP, and all its new milk processing units are end-to-end automated with Siemens technology. Tech adoption, he said, has helped in uninterrupted supply to consumers, while at the same time, farmers are relieved their milk got marketed even in a lockdown situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hyderabad-based private sector dairy brand, Heritage Foods, is also investing big on technology. A user of IBM infrastructure, its executive director Brahmani Nara said: SAP-integrated solution enables timely automated milk payments to village level suppliers. We have honoured hassle-free 100% milk procurement and payments to farmers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Technology, she added, has become the backbone in maintaining the business. During the lockdown, the firm ensured door delivery of products, with leads captured using WhatsApp and social media.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to her, milk transport vehicles are monitored through GPS Solutions to ensure they reach their destination in time and to maintain consistent quality. "Technology has become the backbone in maintaining business discipline and we were able to smoothly close our annual accounts in time and adhere to all compliances, despite relaxations by the Government," she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Relief for pharma firms as govt starts clearing API imports from China Poll</title>
            <link>https://smartinvestor.business-standard.com/market/Compnews-647806-Compnewsdet-Relief_for_pharma_firms_as_govt_starts_clearing_API_imports_from_China.htm</link>
            <description> Easing restrictions on imports from China, the Customs department has decided to clear pharma raw material shipments from that country.&#60;p&#62;Consignments of 11 top importers, including LG, Samsung, Toyota, Honda, and Siemens, will also be allowed entry, relieving them of the 100 per cent inspection rule.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at Indian ports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After representations from industry bodies, the government on Tuesday cleared imports of active pharma ingredients (APIs) from China. Besides, the top importers falling within the Tier 3 category of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme were given exemption from stringent scrutiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Imports of APIs and shipments from AEO T3 importers have been exempt from the 100 per cent check. The Indian pharma industry is heavily dependent on API imports from China and they were facing a huge shortage of raw material. Besides, the tier 3 AEOs are the top importers who meet the highest level of compliance, so they have been given the relaxation,"said a government official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said these shipments would get moving from Wednesday. Over 60 per cent of APIs used in India come from China. On June 22, Customs officials in Chennai and Vizag were asked to put all shipments from China on hold until further orders. This was done on the basis of intelligence inputs about illegal imports of narcotics".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Informal instructions were given to all ports and airports to do 100 per cent physical checks of shipments originating in China. Bilateral trade between China and India was worth $88 billion in FY19, with a deficit of $53.5 billion in Chinas favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is also heavily dependent on China for intermediates and key starting material (KSM) for making drugs. This dependence has grown over the years as local manufacturers have moved to high-margin products (after they could not expand freely due to pollution norms) and Chinese APIs are 30 per cent cheaper than domestic stuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country mostly imports APIs and intermediates for vitamins (like Vitamin C), common antibiotics, and metformin (diabetes) from China. The government has now drawn up a plan to reduce dependence on the country by incentivising the local production of APIs through production-linked incentives (PLI) of up to Rs 10 crore. The government has identified 41 products (molecules), covering 53 crucial APIs, for which India is dependent on China. Almost 80 per cent of the 41 are intermediates. In 2016, the Customs department had launched the Authorised Economic Operator, or AEO, scheme. It is a voluntary programme, under which an importer gets preferential treatment from Customs for being compliant with supply-chain security standards. AEOs get benefits like fast-tracking shipments, deferred payments, exemption from issuing guarantees, and preferential treatment from Customs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They are classified into three categories  T1, T2, and T3  with T3 representing the highest level of compliance. Of the more than 3,000 AEOs, only 11 are in the T3 category. Meanwhile, the government is planning to curtail imports of at least 300 non-essential items from China, either through duty hikes and imposing non-tariff barriers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Multiple agencies, fragmented accountability: The stumbling blocks in ensuring clean air</title>
            <link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/multiple-agencies-fragmented-accountability-the-stumbling-blocks-in-ensuring-clean-air</link>
            <description> Mumbai's clean air plan lists 58 measures across 16 different agencies. However, an independent analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and&#60;p&#62;Water and Urban Emissions has revealed how around 60% of these remedial actions come under the ambit of multiple agencies, which could fragment the accountability&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mumbai: Multiple agencies, lack of cross departmental co-ordination and fragmented accountability may be stumbling blocks in ensuring clean, unpolluted air for citizens.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mumbai's clean air plan lists 58 measures across 16 different agencies. However, an independent analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Urban Emissions has revealed how around 60% of these remedial actions come under the ambit of multiple agencies, which could fragment the accountability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Launched in January 2019 by the Union Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) directed 102 cities, including 17 in Maharashtra, to create city-specific clean air plans.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is a primary mitigation measure to reduce particulate matter (PM) concentration by 20%-30% till 2024, with 2017 as the base year. In August 2019, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) added another 20 cities to this list.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mitigation measures include plying electric vehicles for public transport, establishment of charging stations, use of bio-ethanol, road widening, monitoring industrial emissions, stopping open burning of waste, establishment of compost pits, control measures for fugitive emissions at construction sites, maintaining 33% forest cover and doorstep collection of segregated waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Kurinji Selvaraj, research analyst, CEEW, said that Mumbai's action plan was among the few plans which contained information on sources and listed financial requirements for implementation. But though independent estimates suggest that around a third of Mumbai's air pollution originates outside city limits, the plan fails to highlight any measures to ensure regional coordination.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mumbai secured the highest allocation out of the Rs 4,400 crore for clean air initiatives announced in this year's union budget. However, the allocation of Rs 488 crore for the city is equivalent to the amount budgeted for just two action points, namely regular checking of vehicles and promoting bicycle infrastructure, in the plan, added Selvaraj.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The analysis of Maharashtra's city clean air plans reveals that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is in charge of just 20% of the mitigation activities, while 41% activities come under the ambit of municipal corporations and urban local bodies (ULBs), and 22% under the department of transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More importantly, the report has pointed out that the clean air plans of all cities in Maharashtra lack a legal mandate for implementation. It has recommended that once a city has been designated as non-attainment, the preparation of plans should be mandated by law.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (To view our epaper please click here .

            <title>How We Rank Cars: MotorTrend Ultimate Car Rankings Explained</title>
            <link>https://www.motortrend.com/news/motortrend-ultimate-car-rankings-how-it-works/</link>
            <description> Our sophisticated car-ratings system can help you find a new car in a way only MotorTrend can.&#60;p&#62;With MotorTrend's help, finding a new car doesn't need to feel overwhelming anymore. In fact, as we reveal the top-ranked cars in more than two dozen classes, the new-car buying process might just shift from dread to a little fun.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Building on 70 years of experience testing and evaluating the latest new vehicles, the MotorTrend Ultimate Car Rankings are the most sophisticated, comprehensive, and forward-thinking car-ratings system around. Your money is important, so when it comes to finding a new car, let the experts at MotorTrend help you make the most of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Check out the rankings for yourself right here.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A Smart System&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MotorTrend Ultimate Car Rankings recognize that one-size-fits-all rankings systems don't make sensebuyers of small sedans and three-row luxury SUVs don't have the same priorities. Our proprietary algorithm weighs rankings criteria based on the varying needs of what buyers like you want in different vehicle classes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also crucial is the fact that our rankings system emphasizes the performance of higher-sales-volume trims and powertrains. So let's say a high-performance variant of a car is mind-blowingly good but doesn't sell anywhere near as well as the more affordable and less powerful version most people buya model which our testers consider mediocre. That model's overall rank will more highly reflect the latter. It works the other way, too: We may appreciate the appeal of one model at a specific price point, but evaluating the entire range may reveal different strengths and weaknesses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MotorTrend's Car, Truck, and SUV of the Year process has been evolving for decades, and our rankings take their cue from those highly respected awards. Our rankings system considers performance of intended function, fuel economy and driving range, technology and design innovation, value, and safety. On a 10-point scale, scores around 7 represent average performance. Any vehicle whose scores approach or surpass 8 is delivering an above-average or excellent performance. Scores around 6 or below for any part of our criteria aren't up to the segment's standard. Note: A subcompact SUV that scores a 7 isn't necessarily as good (or bad) as a sports car that has the same scorewe keep the scores relevant only within their own segment, against their peers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Is that luxury sedan's suspension comfortable enough? Can that family SUV fit everyone and their stuff while still giving you confidence behind the wheel? Does that hybrid deliver the fuel efficiency green-car shoppers want? These are the types of questions we ask ourselves by always keeping in mind the segment in which each car competes. Performance of Intended Function is incredibly important, and that's why it's the most heavily weighted criterion in almost every vehicle subclass we rank.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Driving performance lives at the core of Performance of Intended Function in our rankings system. By testing cars on a track, we can evaluate them at their limits as well as what they're like around townbecause no one plans a panic-braking stop. Our testing also provides data points for acceleration, something not everyone will care about until, say, your underpowered car needs to execute a pass. Clearly, driving performance matters even with sensible family cars. A well-engineered car gives you confidence in any driving situation, with all the mechanical bits performing up to the standards of the vehicle class.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MotorTrend testing staff rates each vehicle in a number of key areas, including steering, handling, ride comfort, the transmission, brake feel (different from actual braking performance), and the engine. But we also capture data on how much space a vehicle has for people and their stuff, too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With fuel economy always important to the family pocketbook, we recognize the importance of maximizing your mpgs. But it's more than that. Even if you're not considering a hybrid or electric car, a longer driving range means more time to get errands done between fill-ups or recharging. It could mean the difference between refueling after a long day at work versus having the freedom to do it over a weekend. When it comes to electrics, we also consider how long it takes to recharge.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It's not enough for new cars to offer impressive technology for their respective segmentsthe features need to work well, or drivers won't use them. MotorTrend also recognizes that it's not always about how big an infotainment screen is, but how intuitively it works in a variety of situations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Design innovation captures far more than whether a car's design will turn heads. Beyond that, we're talking about rear doors on family SUVs that conveniently open to nearly 90 degrees, clever storage bins where you wouldn't expect them, smartly located USB ports, or a set of SUV roof-rail crossbars that are remarkably easy to use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MotorTrend editors fully appreciate that you're making payments for years after the new car smell fades. That's why our value component is largely informed by the sharp folks at IntelliChoice (part of the MotorTrend Group). With decades of experience, IntelliChoice analyzes important five-year cost-of-ownership data points, including depreciation, repair costs, insurance, maintenance, financing, and fuel. There's far more to value than picking the cheapest car in your price range, and with IntelliChoice's assistance, we've got your back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When it comes to safety, not all cars are created equal. In MotorTrend Ultimate Car Rankings, safety functions as a minor bonus for vehicles that earn top grades in IIHS or NHTSA tests.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We're here to help you navigate the complicated world of new car shopping. If you're shopping across segmentsmaybe you like the style of midsize sedans but appreciate the practicality of similarly priced SUVsremember that scores are only comparable within each segment. Consider approaching a cross-segment search by picking the top-ranked cars in a couple segments, and consult our thorough Make-Model pages about each car to check out pros and cons.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our system is geared toward higher-sales-volume models because we're looking to help as many consumers as possibleautomotive goodness isn't always spread evenly across a model's range. You can trust MotorTrend's rankings because of our system's unique mix of subjective and objective data, and because our algorithm takes into account the needs of buyers in different segments.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> RMI India: New Report Highlights Emerging Challenges and Opportunities for India's Transition to Clean Mobility and Power Systems in the Context of&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 NEW DELHI, June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report by NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) identifies how COVID-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors. The report recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country's leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy. COVID-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India's transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences. The new report, titled Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities for India's Energy and Mobility Sectors, advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said that he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. "India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," he said. "Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness," added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. "We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses-the transport and power sectors-and emerge stronger." The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programs to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities," said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog. Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies. "The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India's public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India," said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives," said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. "As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air." The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.

            <title>Jeff Bezos, Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, and other billionaire wealth gainers of the pandemic</title>

            <description> The worlds wealthiest grew their fortunes even as the coronavirus pandemic shut down global economies. The biggest gainers of 2020 include some usual suspects and some new entrants.&#60;p&#62;The rich get richer and the poor get poorer is an aphorism derived from English poet PB Shelleys A Defence of Poetry written in 1821.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But even 200 years later, the statement couldnt have been any truer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even as the world faces its worst economic recession since t he Great Depression of the 1930s, with global stock markets tanking, currencies plunging, tens of millions of jobs being lost, and a massive humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of us, the ultra-rich continue to get richer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Wealth Management&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mukesh Ambani joins Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg in the top 10 billionaires' club&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They have remained unscathed by the socio-economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Between March and May, the worlds top 25 billionaires accumulated over $255 billion in wealth, according to Forbes. Further, 29 new billionaires were added in the last three months, the wealth tracker found.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June, their net worths surged further, and US billionaires alone were estimated to have gained a whopping $565 billion since the start of the lockdown, according to the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness. That is an increase of 20 percent, the study announced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Americas top five billionaires saw their wealth soar by $101.7 billion since the start of the pandemic. These are owners or business heads of giant companies that have a presence across the globe. Even minor fluctuations in their market cap can result in swift inflation (or the reverse) in personal fortunes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here are some of the worlds biggest wealth gainers during COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jeff Bezos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jeff Bezos is the richest man in history. Hes been the leader of the billionaire pack since 2017, and despite minor fluctuations in wealth following his much-publicised divorce with Mackenzie Bezos in 2019, the Amazon founder retains the top spot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Despite giving away $36 billion as part of his divorce settlement, Bezos wealth has swelled riding on Amazons growth. He has added $46.4 billion to his wealth since March, and his net worth is now estimated to be $161 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bezos derives his fortune from his 15.1 percent share in Amazon ; the company stock has gained nearly 31 percent in 2020, riding on a surge in online orders as hundreds of millions of people stayed locked in due to the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jeff Bezos tops billionaires list; wealth remains unaffected by coronavirus and divorce&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Elon Musk&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Yourstory&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Elon Musk&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Elon Musk is the 20th richest person in the world with a fortune of $46.9 billion. The Tesla founder has added $19.3 billion to this wealth this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;His wealth accumulation is riding on Teslas soaring stock that has gained a whopping 73 percent since the beginning of 2020. Musk owns close to 19 percent stake in the electric vehicle company, which has wooed investors and remained insulated from the coronavirus shocks in the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier in June, Tesla stock hit a record high of $1,000 making the founder richer by $2 billion overnight. As CNBC described it, Musk has added a Marc Benioff and a Rupert Murdoch to his wealth just in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mukesh Ambani&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mukesh Ambani&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mukesh Ambani has had a memorable 2020, entering the coveted top 10 billionaires club last week, riding on an unprecedented Rs 1.16 lakh crore investment spree in Reliance Industries digital arm - Jio Platforms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The homegrown billionaire has added $5.79 billion to his wealth this year, and his fortune is worth $64.4 billion. Ambani is currently the worlds eighth richest person, according to the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bloomberg Billionaires Index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides a series of billion-dollar investments in Jio, the petroleum-to-telecom conglomerate also completed a Rs 53,000-crore rights issue in May. As a result, Reliance stock gained 6.5 percent on the BSE in the last two months, pushing Ambanis wealth up further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Inside Jios billion-dollar deals: Why investors are flocking to Mukesh Ambani's $65B internet biz&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eric Yuan&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eric Yuan, Zoom&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eric Yuan.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eric Yuan, the Founder of video communications startup Zoom, was almost unheard of until 2020. But the pandemic served as the biggest inflection point for the Silicon Valley upstart, which has become the default remote collaboration tool for hundreds of millions of users across the globe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Zoom shares have gained 130 percent, becoming NASDAQs best performing stock of 2020. The companys valuation now stands at $70 billion, and the Chinese-American billionaire has added $9.42 billion to his wealth this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Yuan is currently ranked 115th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated net worth of $13 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mark Zuckerberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mark Zuckerberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest wealth gainer of 2020 until recently. The Facebook CEO saw his net worth grow 45 percent to $86 billion, making him the third richest person in the world  after Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sign up for Newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Check out our popular newsletters and subscribe&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dropdown * indicates mandatory fields&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Zuckerberg lost $7.2 billion overnight dropping to the fourth place on the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The wealth erosion was caused by an ad boycott on Facebook by leading MNCs, including HUL, Starbucks, and more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The social media giant saw $56 billion wiped off its market cap, as shares tanked 8.3 percent. Zuckerberg is worth $82.3 billion at present, with a net year-to-date addition of $3.9 billion in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mark Zuckerberg loses $7B in a day as top brands boycott Facebook ads&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Steve Ballmer&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Steve Ballmer&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Steve Ballmer with NR Narayanamurthy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has added $12.2 billion to his wealth growing it to&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;$70.9 billion at the end of June. Hes the worlds fifth richest person as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ballmer is still Microsofts biggest shareholder, ahead of even Bill Gates, whos donated a significant portion of his wealth to charity. The rise in demand for the software giants video collaboration platforms&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Microsoft Teams and Skype after the pandemic has resulted in a stock gain of 15 percent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the last five years, after Ballmer quit Microsoft board, his net worth has more than tripled. He is also the owner of professional basketball team Los Angeles Clippers, which has a valuation of $2.2 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Pony Ma&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Tencent CEO&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Tencent CEO Pony Ma | Photo: Fortune&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Tencent CEO Pony Ma became Chinas richest person surpassing Alibaba Founder Jack Ma in June. The former has added $10.3 billion to his fortune this year, and is currently ranked 19th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Pony Ma, who owns seven percent in Tencent, has a net worth of $49 billion. His swelling wealth is a result of the $40 billion surge in the online gaming gian ts valuation last week. Tencent, which owns popular titles like PUBG, Clash of Clans, and Honour of Kings, has reported a boom in gaming revenues in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Additionally, the company stock surged riding on its venture arm Tencent Holdings investment in rapidly-growing ecommerce platform Pinduoduo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China's battle of billionaires: Alibaba's Jack Ma loses richest tag to Tencent's Pony Ma&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Colin Huang&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Colin Huang&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Photo: South China Morning Post&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Colin Huang is possibly the least well-known name on this list.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the Chinese billionaire, whos the Founder and CEO of Pinduoduo, saw his fortune grow by $24.6 billion this year as his Tencent-backed company became China's third largest ecommerce platform after Alibaba and JD.com. Huang now ranks 23rd on the billionaires list with a net worth of $44.2 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hes also Chinas third-richest person after Tencents Pony Ma and Alibabas Jack Ma. His wealth gain is the second-highest after that of Jeff Bezos. Meanwhile, NASDAQ-listed Pinduoduo has defied the global stock market crash to record unprecedented growth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Edited by Teja Lele Desai)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Strange New Species Discovered in Abyss at The Bottom of The Pacific Ocean</title>
            <link>https://trueviralnews.com/strange-new-species-discovered-in-abyss-at-the-bottom-of-the-pacific-ocean/</link>
            <description> Scientists have discovered four new species and two new genera inhabiting the deep, abyssal landscape that lines the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.&#60;p&#62;The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a vast, recessed fracture zone covering some 4.5 million square kilometres (1.7 million square miles) of the central Pacific, is considered something of a prize in the mining sector due to its abundance of valuable metals and rare earth minerals deposited in polymetallic nodules along the sea bed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Yet ancient minerals arent the only things of wonder down here. In a new study, researchers report the identification of a number of deep-sea creatures unknown to science before now, living at depths greater than 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) below the oceans surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The specimens in question are known as xenophyophores, a clade of giant, single-celled protozoans that belong to the class foraminifera.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Xenophyophores are one of the most common types of large life-forms found along the CCZ abyssal plains, and while theyve been described since the late 19th century, theres not an awful lot we know about them, largely due to the extreme depths at which they reside.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These four new species and two new genera have increased the number of described xenophyophores in the CCZ abyss to 17 (22 percent of the global total for this group), with many more known but still undescribed, says marine ecologist Andrew Gooday from the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This part of the Pacific Ocean is clearly a hotspot of xenophyophore diversity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among the new discoveries is the new genus Abyssalia, named after the abyss in which it lurks. In a 2018 expedition aboard the RV Kilo Moana in 2018 in the western CCZ, the researchers found two&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Abyssalia species: A. foliformis and A. sphaerica.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These xenophyophores have shells called tests, made up of tiny particles glued together. In the case of&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Abyssalia, the shells are made from a homogeneous mesh of sponge spicules, with no distinct surface layer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A. sphaerica takes on a spherical shape  resembling a somewhat matted dandelion  while A.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;foliformis embodies a flatter, leaf-like shape.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The other new genus identified, Moanammina, took its name from Moana, meaning ocean in Hawaiian, Maori, and other Polynesian languages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Moanammina semicircularis has a stalked, fan-shaped test, while another new species, Psammina tenuis, belonging to the genus Psammina, has a delicate, thin, plate-like test.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The researchers also discovered what they suggest could be a novel xenophyophore in a spherical mudball shape, but unfortunately its mudball-like composition disintegrated before a detailed examination could confirm its identity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As images go, its not a bad metaphor for the delicate, little-understood ecosystem these xenophyophores inhabit at the deep recesses of the CCZ.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We see them everywhere on the seafloor in many different shapes and sizes. They clearly are very important members of the rich biological communities living in the CCZ, says oceanographer Craig Smith from the University of Hawaii Mnoa, the chief scientist on the RV Kilo Moana cruise.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among other things they provide microhabitats and potential food sources for other organisms. We need to learn much more about the ecology [of] these weird protozoans if we wish to fully understand how seafloor mining might impact these seafloor communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Do Hedge Funds Really Like Meta Financial Group Inc. (CASH)?</title>
            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-really-meta-financial-162550079.html</link>
            <description> We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, which is why imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors.&#60;p&#62;With billions of dollars in assets, professional investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do. However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, let's examine the smart money sentiment towards Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CASH ) and determine whether hedge funds skillfully traded this stock.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CASH shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers of late. CASH was in 13 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2020. There were 12 hedge funds in our database with CASH positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that CASH isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETFs by 58 percentage points since March 2017 ( see the details here ). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 36% through May 18th. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one . We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. For example we are checking out stocks recommended/scorned by legendary Bill Miller . Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&#38;P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to go over the fresh hedge fund action encompassing Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CASH&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How are hedge funds trading Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH)?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Heading into the second quarter of 2020, a total of 13 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of 8% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in CASH over the last 18 quarters. So, let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to Insider Monkey's hedge fund database, Wilmot B. Harkey and Daniel Mack's Nantahala Capital Management has the most valuable position in Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH), worth close to $39.1 million, accounting for 1.5% of its total 13F portfolio. The second most bullish fund manager is Richard Driehaus of Driehaus Capital, with a $9.3 million position; 0.3% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Some other professional money managers that hold long positions contain Parsa Kiai's Steamboat Capital Partners , John Osterweis's Osterweis Capital Management and Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Steamboat Capital Partners allocated the biggest weight to Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH), around 1.62% of its 13F portfolio. Nantahala Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 1.46 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CASH.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As one would reasonably expect, specific money managers have jumped into Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH) headfirst. Citadel Investment Group, managed by Ken Griffin, assembled the biggest position in Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH). Citadel Investment Group had $1.3 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Mika Toikka's AlphaCrest Capital Management also made a $1.1 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are Mark Coe's Intrinsic Edge Capital, Renaissance Technologies, and Greg Eisner's Engineers Gate Manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH). These stocks are Sandy Spring Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ: SASR ), Anterix Inc. (NASDAQ: ATEX ), Natus Medical Inc (NASDAQ: NTUS ), and FARO Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: FARO ). All of these stocks' market caps are closest to CASH's market cap.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position SASR,12,36542,-3 ATEX,11,415373,-1 NTUS,23,72047,-1 FARO,12,112398,0 Average,14.5,159090,-1.25 [/table]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; View table here if you experience formatting issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As you can see these stocks had an average of 14.5 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $159 million. That figure was $71 million in CASH's case. Natus Medical Inc (NASDAQ: NTUS ) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Anterix Inc. (NASDAQ: ATEX ) is the least popular one with only 11 bullish hedge fund positions. Meta Financial Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CASH) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.4% in 2019 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks gained 13.3% in 2020 through June 25th and surpassed the market by 16.8 percentage points. Unfortunately CASH wasn't nearly as popular as these 10 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); CASH investors were disappointed as the stock returned -19.8% during the second quarter and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [company-follow-email id=907471][/company-follow-email]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Disclosure: None.

            <description> West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha on Tuesday wrote to Secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation P.S. Kharola urging him to stop domestic flights from high prevalence places to Kolkata.&#60;p&#62;West Bengal is witnessing a steep rise in cases...Accordingly, I request you not to schedule any flight to West Bengal from high prevalence places viz..Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai, Indore, Ahmedabad and Surat and to stop the movement of flights from these cities to Kolkata or Bagdogra for two weeks from July, Mr. Sinha said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been demanding ban on flights. During the day Ms. Banerjee threatened to acquire 6,000 private buses in Kolkata by Wednesday by imposition of National Disaster Management Act.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To commandeer buses&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If the owners do not operate buses by Wednesday, we will be left with no option but to acquire them. also Mr Sinha wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla seeking permission to invoke the NDMA.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The State government had proposed a Rs 15,000 aid to private bus owners but they were not willing to bring the bus on the streets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The bus owners were demanding a hike in the bus fares and commuters in Kolkata and suburbs have been having a tough time in reaching their destinations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In another letter addressed to the Prime Minister Ms Banerjee opposed the Centres decision to bring cooperative banks of the country under the Reserve Bank of India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is the only thing that we have in our control. The Union government should not take away that control. Our government has decided to write to the NITI Aayog chief against the decision, the Chief Minister added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-dropped-ball-diodes-173707874.html</link>
            <description> We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, which is why imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors.&#60;p&#62;With billions of dollars in assets, professional investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do. However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, let's examine the smart money sentiment towards Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ: DIOD ) and determine whether hedge funds skillfully traded this stock.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ: DIOD shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers of late.

A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's monthly stock picks returned 101% since March 2017 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETFs by more than 58 percentage points. Our short strategy outperformed the S&#38;P 500 short ETFs by 20 percentage points annually ( see the details here ). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [caption id="attachment_844243" align="aligncenter" width="400"] Donald Sussman of Paloma Partners[/caption]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now we're going to analyze the recent hedge fund action encompassing Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ: DIOD&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Hedge fund activity in Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Q1's end, a total of 13 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -28% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in DIOD over the last 18 quarters. With the smart money's positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were adding to their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Chuck Royce's Royce &#38; Associates has the largest position in Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD), worth close to $19.1 million, amounting to 0.3% of its total 13F portfolio. The second most bullish fund manager is Fisher Asset Management , managed by Ken Fisher, which holds a $9.8 million position; less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Other members of the smart money with similar optimism contain Michael Rockefeller and Karl&#195;&#161;Kroeker's Woodline Partners, Renaissance Technologies and Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management . In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Zebra Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD), around 1.05% of its 13F portfolio. Woodline Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 0.36 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to DIOD.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD) has witnessed falling interest from the smart money, it's safe to say that there was a specific group of hedgies that elected to cut their positions entirely heading into Q4. Interestingly, Brandon Haley's Holocene Advisors sold off the largest stake of the 750 funds watched by Insider Monkey, comprising close to $2.9 million in stock. Peter Algert and Kevin Coldiron's fund, Algert Coldiron Investors , also dumped its stock, about $2 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest fell by 5 funds heading into Q4.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD). These stocks are DouYu International Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: DOYU ), Sterling Bancorp (NYSE: STL ), Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ICPT ), and Brookfield Business Partners L.P. (NYSE: BBU ). This group of stocks' market caps resemble DIOD's market cap.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position DOYU,15,30200,9 STL,25,176182,-5 ICPT,19,258760,-8 BBU,2,1459,-2 Average,15.25,116650,-1.5 [/table]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; View table here if you experience formatting issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As you can see these stocks had an average of 15.25 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $117 million. That figure was $50 million in DIOD's case. Sterling Bancorp (NYSE: STL ) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Brookfield Business Partners L.P. (NYSE: BBU ) is the least popular one with only 2 bullish hedge fund positions. Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our calculations showed that top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.4% in 2019 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks gained 13.3% in 2020 through June 25th but beat the market by 16.8 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on DIOD, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned 21.9% during the second quarter and outperformed the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [company-follow-email id=29002][/company-follow-email]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Disclosure: None.

            <title>Were Hedge Funds Right About Dumping Quanex Building Products Corporation (NX)?</title>
            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-hedge-funds-dumping-quanex-184205028.html</link>
            <description> Insider Monkey has processed numerous 13F filings of hedge funds and successful value investors to create an extensive database of hedge fund holdings.&#60;p&#62;The 13F filings show the hedge funds' and successful investors' positions as of the end of the first quarter. You can find articles about an individual hedge fund's trades on numerous financial news websites. However, in this article we will take a look at their collective moves over the last 4.5 years and analyze what the smart money thinks of Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE: NX ) based on that data and determine whether they were really smart about the stock.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Is Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE: NX going to take off soon? The smart money was getting less optimistic. The number of long hedge fund bets dropped by 7 in recent months. Our calculations also showed that NX isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETFs by more than 58 percentage points since March 2017 ( see the details here ). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 36% through May 18th. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [caption id="attachment_30621" align="aligncenter" width="400"] Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management[/caption]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one . We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. For example we are checking out stocks recommended/scorned by legendary Bill Miller . Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&#38;P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. Now we're going to review the new hedge fund action surrounding Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE: NX&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How have hedgies been trading Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX)?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the end of the first quarter, a total of 13 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -35% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 16 hedge funds with a bullish position in NX a year ago. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Among these funds, Renaissance Technologies held the most valuable stake in Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX), which was worth $18.5 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was D E Shaw which amassed $5.4 million worth of shares. AQR Capital Management, Arrowstreet Capital, and Citadel Investment Group were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Renaissance Technologies allocated the biggest weight to Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX), around 0.02% of its 13F portfolio. Engineers Gate Manager is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.02 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to NX.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Seeing as Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) has faced bearish sentiment from the smart money, logic holds that there lies a certain "tier" of funds that decided to sell off their full holdings last quarter. Intriguingly, Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP cut the largest investment of the "upper crust" of funds tracked by Insider Monkey, comprising an estimated $4 million in stock. David Harding's fund, Winton Capital Management , also said goodbye to its stock, about $1.1 million worth. These moves are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 7 funds last quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) but similarly valued. These stocks are Experience Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: EXPC ), Sorrento Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRNE ), Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNDX ), and Puma Biotechnology Inc (NYSE: PBYI ). This group of stocks' market values match NX's market value.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position EXPC,14,88922,9 SRNE,5,10319,0 SNDX,19,74473,8 PBYI,20,100494,3 Average,14.5,68552,5 [/table]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; View table here if you experience formatting issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As you can see these stocks had an average of 14.5 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $69 million. That figure was $35 million in NX's case. Puma Biotechnology Inc (NYSE: PBYI ) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Sorrento Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRNE ) is the least popular one with only 5 bullish hedge fund positions. Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our calculations showed that top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.4% in 2019 and outperformed the S&#38;P 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks gained 13.3% in 2020 through June 25th but beat the market by 16.8 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on NX, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned 25.9% during the second quarter and outperformed the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [company-follow-email id=1423221][/company-follow-email]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Disclosure: None.

            <title>In 8-10 years, we will shift to 65% renewable energy</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/-in-8-10-years-we-will-shift-to-65-renewable-energy-11593564375687.html</link>
            <description> We need to find viable alternatives to power purchase agreements that are a win-win for everybody. We are working on solutions, says Rajiv Srivastava, MD and CEO, IEX&#60;p&#62;MUMBAI : During the initial months of the nationwide lockdown, several states turned to exchange-traded power to reduce their procurement costs and found platforms, such as the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), to be a source of cheap power. In an interview for Mint s Pivot or Perish series, Rajiv Srivastava, managing director and chief executive, IEX, said the energy sector will see less emphasis on long-term power contracts, and more on lowering costs and increasing consumer choices. Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Electricity demand crashed in the initial months of the lockdown and has since fluctuated a lot. How has IEX dealt with this?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We saw national power demand drop drastically in March and April, and then there was a rebound in May. In June, we have recovered to 90% of pre-covid demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What we have done at IEX is to support utilities to ensure uninterrupted power supply. We automated 100% of our remote operations and invested in the platforms technology to cope with the flexibility in demand. In fact, states such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana leveraged the exchange for low-cost power, and enhanced their financial liquidity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We launched the real-time market in June, which allows you to trade energy over shorter delivery times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We made a software investment of  3 crore just for these two months; we are making a much larger investment for the future.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our biggest learnings during this period were in the domain of people, and our operating model. People, or human capital, is our biggest asset. Operating from home with no supervision put enormous accountability on our people, but they have continued to deliver their best.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Should the government do more to support the energy sector? Will the 90,000 crore loan package for distribution companies (discoms) be adequate?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is a short-term measure. In March-May, overall realizations for discoms suffered significantly and their most remunerative customers, industrial and commercial users, disappeared, breaking down their financial value chain.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The  90,000 crore liquidity injection is a welcome relief, but this is a short-term measure. The long-term problem is the economic model of generation, transmission and distribution of power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We have created a rigid 25-year term contract for the power supply chain. To benefit from new technology and shift in energy mix, we need to move towards a much more flexible regime.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Should long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) be done away with?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I think so. But, this is a simplistic statement. PPAs are so entrenched in the whole financial modelling of the power sector, we need to find viable alternatives that are a win-win for everybody. We are working on solutions to get to such a model.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides, sectoral efficiencies to reduce losses in transmission and distribution, and a regulatory framework, which allows a more market-driven open sectorjust like in IT, telecom, where market forces playwill lead to healthy growth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Can this happen soon, especially at a time when Indias gross domestic product (GDP) is contracting?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can firefight your problems or make far-reaching changes, and I think the government is thinking of the latter. For instance, there is a great deal of thought going into how renewables should be brought into integration and hybridization of power. The government is talking about becoming self-sufficient in coal; we have coal reserves, so there is no need for us to import coal. The government is also looking at how to make the market more efficient.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These are things that they are working on, on an urgent basis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Doing away with PPAs and diluting the PPA regime, we will get there, but it will take longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You are celebrating the 12th anniversary of IEX. Over the next decade, how do you see Indias energy mix changing and how will IEX cope with these changes?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We foresee a mega shift in how India is going to generate, distribute and consume power. If you look globally, there is trend of four Dsdecarbonization, decentralization, digitalization and democratization. This is defining the energy shift.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government is thinking of decarbonization now that we have a strong emphasis on renewables versus fossil fuel-based generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the next 8-10 years, we will flip from 65% conventional energy today to 65% renewables. This change will also lead to decentralization, because unlike in conventional coal plants, renewable energy is decentralized and built close to consuming populations, so there is a need for a different architecture in transmission and distribution.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This means that there will be huge emphasis on intelligent control systems, virtual power plants, internet-enabled applications, smart grid technologies, etc. This will be driven by cost optimization and consumer choice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Intelligent control systems can allow consumers to determine their power provider and the form of energy they want. We are going to see energy as a service.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>Hindustan Zinc expands capacity of its Sewage Treatment Plants to 55 MLD</title>
            <link>https://udaipurkiran.com/hindustan-zinc-expands-capacity-of-its-sewage-treatment-plants-to-55-mld/</link>
            <description> Udaipur : Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) today announced the commencement of operations at its new 10 million liters per day (MLD) sewage treatment plant in the city.&#60;p&#62;The new facility has increased the total capacity of the sewage treatment plants of HZL to 55 MLD. In addition, the company is also set to complete its 5 MLD capacity unit in the coming weeks, which will further expand the capacity to 60 MLD. Designed on sequential batch reactors (SBR) technology  that ensures chemical free and biological processes; the new 10 MLD plant is producing treated water, 50% of which, is being sent to Aayad River.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The City of Lakes  Udaipur generates roughly 70 MLD of sewage every day. HZL is also in the last leg of commissioning an additional 5 MLD plant, taking the STPs total capacity to 60 MLD, thereby treating almost the entire sewage of Udaipur city and recirculating clean water.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on the initiative, Mr. Sunil Duggal, CEO, Hindustan Zinc &#38; Vedanta Limited, said, We at Hindustan Zinc have always believed in empowering communities through ideas, resources and efforts. In 2014, we set-up Udaipurs first sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 20 MLD under Public-Private-Partnership model. Over the past six years, we are inching towards tripling this capacity. This state of the art 10 MLD plant will further boost our efforts in pursuing our dream of a cleaner and water positive city.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on the same, Mr. Ankit Kumar Sing, IAS, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Udaipur said, We appreciate the efforts of HZL management for setting and completion of 55 MLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) including 10 MLD STP at Udaipur city, within the scheduled period, in accordance to the agreement. Vedantas Hindustan Zinc has always been one of the most preferred partners of Udaipur Municipal Corporation for all social development projects, and we appreciate the efforts they have done.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The SBR technology has a better energy conservation rate whilst also providing chemical free treated water. The energy consumption has reduced on account of fully automated plant running on a hydraulics mechanism. The process of treatment is environment-friendly as well, since no hazardous emissions are generated during the process. An additional contribution to green and renewable energy also comes from the fact that Hindustan Zinc has efficiently utilised the space for these STPs by developing solar panels in close vicinity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Udaipur is among the cities selected under the Government of Indias Smart City Mission. Sewage inflow into Udaipurs lakes was one of the biggest problems plaguing the City of Lakes giving rise to high volumes of pollution. There was a need to develop alternative sources of potable water and conserve the same. HZLs units operate on the principle of zero discharge and the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) represent a significant action taken towards conserving water as well as reducing discharge into the lakes. With this expanded capacity, the Company expects to treat maximum of Udaipurs domestic sewage, helping reduce the dependencies on fresh water.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Equity indices end flat after choppy trade, energy stocks lose</title>
            <link>https://www.newkerala.com/news/2020/116446.htm</link>
            <description> Mumbai, June 30: Equity benchmark indices underwent bouts of volatility on Tuesday but ended flat despite strong global cues after data showed that China's manufacturing sector grew more than expected in June.&#60;p&#62;Investors said traders preferred to book profits and took shelter of safe-haven assets like gold and it is generally considered as a traditional hedge.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The fears of rapid coronavirus and its impact on global growth and rising geopolitical tensions between India-China, US-China and US-European Union has increased the demand for gold. Moreover, rise in crude oil prices and hike in gold ETFs holdings is providing support to the gold price," said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research for Currency at Emkay Global Financial Services.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the closing bell, the BSE S and P Sensex was down by 46 points or 0.13 per cent at 34,916 while the Nifty 50 edged lower by 10 points or 0.1 per cent at 10,302.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sectoral indices at the National Stock Exchange were mixed with Nifty PSU losing by 1.7 per cent and pharma by 1.5 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among stocks, Bharat Petroleum Corporation was down by 2.5 per cent to close at Rs 373.75. Power Grid Corporation fell by 1.9 per cent, GAIL by 1.8 per cent, IndianOil Corporation by 1.7 per cent, Coal India by 1.2 per cent and ONGC by 1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sun Pharma, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel and UPL too closed in the negative terrain.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, auto stocks gained with Maruti Suzuki up by 2.6 per cent at Rs 5,830 per share, Hero MotoCorp by 1.8 per cent and Eicher Motors by 1.1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nestle India, Britannia, Tata Steel and HDFC traded with positive bias but with thin margins.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, Asian shares rose after data in China showed activity quickening in its vast factory sector. That was a hopeful sign for the global economy struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hong Kong stocks were up by 0.5 per cent despite the Chinese parliament's passage of a security law that will increase Beijing's control over the former British colony.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Nikkei rose by 1.33 per cent while shrugging off a decline in Japanese industrial production and South Korean Kospi was up by 0.71 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Customer Accidentally Orders 27 Tesla Model 3 Electric Sedans Worth 1.4 Million Euros</title>
            <link>https://technocodex.com/customer-accidentally-orders-27-tesla-model-3-electric-sedans-worth-1-4-million-euros/</link>
            <description> The customer ended up ordering 27 Tesla Model 3 sedans, worth 1.4 million Euros or Rs. 11.90 crore&#60;p&#62;In what could be one of the most bizarre incidents, recently, a man accidentally placed an order for 27 Tesla Model 3 sedans online, in Germany, due to a technical glitch on the companys website. The customer, who goes by the pseudo name Ballon-Man on Reddit, revealed the entire incident on the online discussion forum. He, along with his father, was trying to place an online order for a base trim of the Tesla Model 3 equipped with Autopilot function, which costs 52,000 Euros (  44.29 lakh). However, while trying to pay the online booking amount, the website responded saying that the order could not be placed because of a payment issue. Surprised, considering they had filled in payment details correctly, the father-son duo tried placing the order again, and got the same response.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Exclusive: Tesla Model 3 Review&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The customer was trying to place an order for a Tesla Model 3 equipped with Autopilot function&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In his post the user said, After looking up problems with Teslas website it became apparent that it wasnt our fault but Teslas, since other users were having problems with the page as well. So, we tried again. Didnt work. So we tried again and again. Finally, after a total of 27 attempts they did manage to place the order and got the confirmation from the website. But, to their surprise, they had ended up ordering not 1 but 27 Model 3 sedans, amounting to a total cost of 1.4 million Euros, which is around  11.90 crore, approximately.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Tesla Model S Becomes The First-Ever Electric Vehicle To Breach 644 Km On A Single Charge&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He added, All 27 times we tried to get through because it didnt work, an order was placed but we got no notification. We only found out when logging in with our Tesla-Account on their website. We ordered 27 Teslas. Now, Tesla charges a non-refundable order fee of 100 Euros, which meant even if they cancelled it, they would still end up paying 2700 Euros, which is close to  2.30 lakh. So, later he called Teslas customer care department and explained the situation, who understood their problem and cancelled the entire order, and even gave them back the entire deposit money. They were instructed to simply place a new order.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> We commend the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis for taking this comprehensive approach to climate-related legislation. This report underlines the top methods by which the U.S. should pursue policy solutions that protect the environment and ensure a prosperous American economy.&#60;p&#62;Washington D.C. - The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) today issued the following statement supporting the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis recommendations on climate policies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We commend the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis for taking this comprehensive approach to climate-related legislation. This report underlines the top methods by which the U.S. should pursue policy solutions that protect the environment and ensure a prosperous American economy. Markets and fair competition are essential tools if America is to efficiently reduce carbon emissions, and so AWEA appreciates the Committee's focus on carbon pricing and a Clean Energy Standard - two flexible, market-based approaches to swiftly and cost-effectively address the climate crisis. We also commend the report for being ambitious enough to tackle the real change needed in the energy sector, such as recognizing the importance of improving the electric system to meet climate targets. As an emissions-free energy source, U.S. onshore and offshore wind power stand ready to play a leading role in affordably reducing carbon pollution, while investing in local communities and providing good-paying jobs across the country." - Tom Kiernan, AWEA CEO.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;####&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;AWEA is the national trade association for the U.S. wind industry, the largest source of renewable energy in the country. We represent 1,000 member companies, 120,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, and a nationwide workforce located across all 50 states. AWEA serves as a powerful voice for how wind works for America. Members include global leaders in wind power and energy development, turbine manufacturing, and component and service suppliers. They gather each year at the Western Hemisphere's largest wind energy event, the AWEA CLEANPOWER Conference &#38; Exhibition, next in Indianapolis, June 7-10, 2021.

            <title>L&#38;T achieves milestone in manufacturing cryostat for Global Fusion Project</title>
            <link>https://www.newkerala.com/news/2020/116484.htm</link>
            <description> Hazira (Gujarat), June 30 (ANI: The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of cryostat -- the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;p&#62;"This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India initiative," the company said in a statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is among the seven elite countries funding the 20 billion dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme at Cadarache in France. This is one of the world's largest research project that seeks to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Today, in Hazira, we celebrate with you the completion of fabrication of all the segments of cryostat, including most recently the segments of the cryostat lid -- again achieved under these challenging conditions," said ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot. L and T's CEO and Managing Director S N Subrahmanyan said the company used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subrahmanyan said the initiative has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly referred to as the top lid weighing 650 metric tonnes will be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER in a reactor pit in southern France. L and T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L and T's heavy engineering business won the prestigious contract in 2012. ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, is the overall in-charge of the Indian participation for this ambitious mega scientific project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Govt plans pass-through in tariffs for already bid-out solar projects</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/govt-plans-pass-through-in-tariffs-for-already-bid-out-solar-projects-11593567133019.html</link>
            <description> Indian customers are willing to pay more for power provided the equipment is made in India, minister Raj Kumar Singh says&#60;p&#62;NEW DELHI : The government plans to allow a pass-through in power tariffs for projects awarded before the basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar cells, modules, and inverters is imposed from 1 August, to protect solar project developers, said two people aware of the development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The move could lead to an increase in electricity tariffs but is being done to help developers set up these projects and maintain Indias clean energy trajectory as the government tightens its economic squeeze on China. An Indian is willing to pay more for power, provided the equipment is made in India, power and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh had said earlier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With tensions mounting along the India-China border, India is working on a wider decoupling exercise that involves imposing tariff and non-tariff barriers to check Chinese imports. This involves coming up with a list of approved manufacturers for government-supported schemes in the clean energy sector, including projects from where electricity distribution companies procure electricity for supply to their consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A similar approved list of modules and manufacturers is being made for the conventional power sector as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All bids placed before the application of ALMM wont have to comply with it,"said a government official, one of the two persons mentioned above, requesting anonymity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The other measure includes prior-permission requirements for power equipment imports from countries India has a conflict with, Mint had reported earlier. The government also aims to provide viability gap funding (VGF) to domestic manufacturers to promote its Make in India initiative.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The imposition of BCD on imported solar cells, modules and inverters is to be followed by a plan to impose import duty on wafers and ingots that go into the manufacturing of solar cells and modules. The BCD follows the 29 July expiry of safeguard duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and Malaysia.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even as India is imposing a basic customs duty on imported solar cells, modules and inverters, any increase in costs due to a change in law after a bid has been placed will be a pass-through. There is a formula for pass-through in the bidding guidelines and all previous bids will be grandfathered,"said the other government official mentioned above requesting anonymity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New Delhi also plans to discourage states from using Chinese equipment and technology in the strategic power sector by withholding funding to such projects from government-owned lenders, Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC), Rural Electrification Corp. Ltd (REC), and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), if they use Chinese imports, Mint reported on 28 June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This will be done after the ALMM is put in place,"said the first government official mentioned above.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>IspatiIrada campaign has objective of promoting appropriate steel usage: Pradhan</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111356-ispatiirada-campaign-has-objective-of-promoting-appropriate-steel-usage-pradhan</link>
            <description> Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Steel and Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas today chaired a webinar on "IspatiIrada: Enhancing steel usage with a focus on construction and infrastructure sectors".&#60;p&#62;Minister of State for Steel Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Secretary, Steel, Senior officers from the Ministry of Steel, subject experts, industry leaders, academicians, researchers, large users and regulators also participated in the webinar.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that the steel industry plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a nation. He said that India has become the second-largest producer of steel in the world, and has the capacity to build quality products, but per-capita consumption of steel in the country is almost one-third of the global average, and there is an immense potential upside to it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Talking about the IspatiIrada, the Minister said, "Ispat is not just a material but it is a state of mind. India has an 'IspatiIrada' to be an inclusive developed nation."He said that it is not a mere slogan, but a manifestation of the Government's determination to strengthen the economy, ameliorate the condition of the poor, improve the environment and enhance employment opportunities. He further stated that the collaborative branding campaign 'IspatiIrada'has the objective of promoting appropriate steel usage in the country, and aims to leverage the usage of steel as an easy-to-use, environment-friendly, cost-effective, affordable and strength-giving material.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Minister said that we have to identify the opportunities and challenges in, increasing steel consumption. He said that the Ministry of Steel has already discussed with key infrastructure ministries about more steel usage, and is engaging with various departments, state governments and other stakeholders. He called for "Make in Steel" through a transition to more steel-intensive construction. India is investing big time in creating an infrastructure for future across sectors like railways, roads, civil aviation, energy, which will further provide impetus to the steel consumption in the country. He informed that a working group will be set up which will regularly monitor the steps being taken to enhance the steel usage. He asked the Webinar participants to come with a few solid recommendations, which would be implemented.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In his address, Shri Kulaste said that there is a wide scope of increasing the consumption of steel in the country, particularly in rural areas. The Consumption of steel in rural areas is almost one-quarter of the national average. He said that the increase in steel consumption will give impetus to the economic activities, help in improving the environment, and provide employment opportunities. He said that the Government has announced the National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs. 103 lakh crore in the infrastructure sector and this will lead to enhanced steel demand. Ministry of Steel is already in talks with other departments to increase steel usage. Quoting the example of Japan, which is earthquake-prone and uses upto 80% steel in its structures, Shri Kulaste said that the Steel provides strength and stability to them. He also said the steel industry will have to find ways to reduce the cost of construction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(With Inputs from PIB)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>15 Million Tonnes By March-End: Minister On Private Firms' Coal Capacity</title>
            <link>https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/private-firms-could-develop-15-million-tonnes-capacity-coal-mines-this-year-minister-2254815</link>
            <description> Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;p&#62;The country's consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," Mr Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country's consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Mr Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9% between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Mr Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7% this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>NITI Aayog releases 'Towards a Clean Energy Economy'report</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111409-niti-aayog-releases-towards-a-clean-energy-economy-report</link>
            <description> NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) today released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities for India's Energy and&#60;p&#62;Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country's leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India's transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. "India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness," added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. "We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhousesthe transport and power sectorsand emerge stronger."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities," said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India's public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India," said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives," said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. "As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(With Inputs from PIB)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Deutsche Bank's Dilipkumar Khandelwal on tech as an enabler for business</title>
            <link>https://www.peoplematters.in/article/technology/deutsche-banks-dilipkumar-khandelwal-on-tech-as-an-enabler-for-business-26179</link>
            <description> The COVID-19 crisis has enabled technology to play a more front and centre role in businesses rather than a support function earlier, says Dilipkumar&#60;p&#62;Khandelwal, Managing Director and Head of Global Technology Centres, Deutsche Bank, in a recent interview with People Matters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The pandemic brought the whole world to a standstill and forced everyone to stay home to ensure health and safety. But many businesses, essential services and learning continued, all thanks to technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Technology, which was being seen as a support function for a while now became the binding force, the glue, keeping everyone together. It enabled people to connect, personally, professionally, and empowered businesses to operate and continue some work even amid the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a recent interview with Dilipkumar Khandelwal, Managing Director and Head of Global Technology Centres, Deutsche Bank, we discuss how the COVID-19 crisis has enabled technology to play a more front and centre role. He shares, We are going through the COVID crisis without much disruption to work or businesses which is key and that's where technology focus needs to continue to be.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Here are the excerpts from the interview:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In your LinkedIn bio, you have written: "believes in the power of technology to transform lives". It is a beautiful thought. Can you elaborate more on this? How do you think technology can transform lives?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Technology is an enabler. If you see around, technology has been playing a major part in making lives simpler. With the development in engineering in the early nineteenth century with the industrial revolution to the computer age starting 1970s, technology has enabled human beings to make their lives simpler.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Technology is acting as an enabler now for organizations as well. Let's take an example of automation through RPA with AI/ML, this makes lives easier for operators where they can move on to do jobs that are more interesting. Advent of cloud technology has made lives easier for developers who can now focus on building out core technology solutions and let the infrastructure be taken care of by cloud providers. During the COVID-19 crisis situation, we have, in Deutsche Bank, enabled more than 80,000 people to work from home, to use collaboration tools and have the business work in a BAU mode.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How has the role of technology increased both in the way you work and you do business?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Technology is an essential driver for the businesses. The COVID-19 crisis has enabled technology to play a more front and centre role in businesses rather than a support function earlier. Now the businesses are aware of the important role technology plays for businesses to run.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At Deutsche Bank the crisis accelerated work we already started as part of our technology strategy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have enabled over 80,000 people for remote access [dbRAS], with on average of 60,000 concurrent users working from remote each day, compared to an average of 20,000 per day in February  enabling them to serve our customers. We have successfully set up traders to work from home in 7 days, a process that would have otherwise taken months. We fast-tracked introduction of collaboration tools as well the introduction of electronic signatures for departments in need to sign documents.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Usage of collaboration tools significantly increased: Skype Conference minutes have exceeded 2 million per day for the first time this week, up from pre-crisis levels of 150,000 minutes. This has helped colleagues to stay in touch.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For BCP planning, we fast-tracked the upgrade of server infrastructure so that we can handle the load of all our colleagues working from home.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As a leader of technology, data, and innovation, how important do you think are these three for any business success? And how can organizations maximize on the benefits of these three critical pillars?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As said above, technology is an enabler and is crucial for businesses. Deutsche Bank has started investing in technology infrastructure and simplification of the technology landscape for the last 2-3 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Cloud technology provides huge opportunities in terms of flexibility, scalability and developer productivity. However, you cannot just lift and shift existing applications and start deploying them on cloud.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; You have to apply common standards to technology environments and modernize applications architecture before moving onto cloud and this standardization work has started a couple of years back which has built the foundation for our cloud journey.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Consistency in modelling and access to all the firm's data is going to be a defining factor in building a simpler technology stack for the bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Innovation is a culture . It's not the duty but the right of technologists to be able to innovate. So, it's as important for an organization to create a culture of innovation as it is for employees to innovate. An environment for innovation can be fostered to make an organization successful and reinvent itself with changing times and business models.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How do you think the role of technology in the banking sector will evolve in the next two to three years?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The technology focus areas will be to simplify landscape. Main focus areas will be:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Consistency of data strategy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Cloud adoption&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; API based technology architecture&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Automation through RPA, AI/ML&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Consistency of data  Data is absolutely essential for success as systems require the right data at right time to operate correctly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Cloud adoption  Cloud, over the coming few years, will be of great help in ensuring that we have state-of-the-art infrastructure that mitigates risk and increases the control and stability of business platforms. Also, it allows banking application-development technology to focus on solving business problems, leaving infrastructure to the infrastructure experts. Over time, we will see more and more banks moving to cloud platforms. Cloud platforms provide the obvious benefits of scaling infrastructure on demand and pay-per-use. But before you move to the cloud, you need to apply common standards across your technology environment and modernize applications to make them cloud-ready. Over the past few years, our teams have significantly raised enterprise-wide technology and architecture standards, which now puts us in a good position to move our cloud strategy forward.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; API based technology architecture  Microservices architecture is the key to achieve API based technology architecture. Applications need to be seen as a combination of various micro-services representing functional units. These services then need a consistent manner of interacting with other microservices so provide information as and when needed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Automation  Technology is all encompassing. While there are technology strategies which we are running around modernizing our application landscape and data availability, we are also very focused on operational processing and how we can move away from manual nature of work. A good example is use of modern technologies like Robotics Process Automation along with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The key is to become simpler and more efficient. A concrete example is the solution of the New York technology start-up WorkFusion, which is used in the Corporate Bank. Artificial intelligence combined with high-speed scanners helps the Trust &#38; Agency Services division to analyze and process large volumes of unstructured documents on a daily basis. Workfusion's AI-driven automation capabilities are also being used to create efficiencies in the time-consuming process of adverse media screening, as part of the bank's know-your-customer screening processes. The software scans news sentiment and context for negative news, rather than looking for rudimentary word associations. Moving into this space provides us quick turnaround times and efficiency gains are quite fast.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How are you preparing for these changes as a business and how are you preparing your talent for the same?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are fully committed to these technological advancements and are taking steps now to be ahead of the game.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In February  March 2020, we started discussions with major cloud service providers to explore options for entering into a cooperation. To match our demands on how the cloud can support emerging technologies. This will greatly help as our developers will be able to focus on application development instead of dealing with the infrastructure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Data continues to remain a major focus area for the bank. We realised early on that we generate a lot of data, and for good reason, but we need to ensure that this data is accessible to all platforms and employees who need it. It's also important that data is not duplicated and moving from one system to another. In Deutsche Bank, we believe in the concept of data at rest rather than data at motion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We created data lakes for different functions, which helped get the transactional data for that function in one place. We then built strong interfaces on top of these data lakes so that they can be accessed in real-time by other platforms. We have followed a similar approach for our Reference Data platforms, where systems access the data using API as and when required, rather than storing their own copy of Reference Data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lastly, how are you dealing with this crisis? What are some personal challenges you think leaders often face in these tough times? How are you ensuring that you keep calm, sail through and help others also in these tough times? Share your tips.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think for most part, our strategy has worked well. We are going through the COVID crisis without much disruption to work or businesses which is key and that's where technology focus needs to continue to be. Most important part is to stay close to our employees as they are the most important assets to the organization. As I said above also, constant communication along with quick decision making and prioritization and then communicating the decisions again back to employees is key.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Second important focus should be flexibility as this will go a long way in the post COVID-19 era. It has now proven beyond doubt that people can be as, if not more, productive working remotely and providing that flexibility to employees will be a key differentiator in being the employer of choice in the post COVID world. And third is prioritization . I cannot stress enough how important this is for success both during and after the COVID-19 era. Given the new normal, companies need the agility to be able to replan quickly. Whether we look at startups or large firms, the above two principles will help move forward quickly and effectively in a post COVID world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Topics: Technology #ResetWithTech&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Mahindra To Launch At Least 3 Electric Vehicles In Current Fiscal  Report</title>
            <link>https://gaadiwaadi.com/mahindra-to-launch-at-least-3-electric-vehicles-in-current-fiscal-report/</link>
            <description> Mahindra Electric will continue to maintain its focus on the electric autos as it feels that the hurdles in import of components from China is a temporary phenomenon&#60;p&#62;In spite of the ongoing challenging circumstances and mass-scale disruptions in the auto sector, Mahindra plans to stay focussed on the electric vehicles segment. In fact, the company plans to launch as many as three new products in the current financial year. It may be noted here that Mahindra Electric sold more than 14,000 EVs last year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among the upcoming electric cars from Mahindra is the eKUV100, an electrified version of the KUV100 that has been in the pipeline for a while now. Other than this, the company will also launch Treo Zor and Atom in the current financial year. The launch of the Treo Zor seems to have been fast-tracked owing to the high demand for the Treo eAuto and Treo Yaari having encouraged the company.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the company has also ensured that in spite of the high focus on electric vehicles, it would not defer any of its plans in the mainstream auto sector. In February, it had come to light that Mahindra Electric was contemplating selling of some of its stake in Mahindra Electric.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/mexican-president-orders-fraud-complaints-against-green-power-firms/76721345</link>
            <description> Since April, the government has sought to prevent more than 40 wind and solar power plants from connecting to the CFE-owned grid, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic requires an uninterrupted power supply&#60;p&#62;MEXICO CITY: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday ordered formal complaints to be drawn up alleging fraud by mostly renewable power companies, but he gave no evidence backing up the complaints.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ramping up his repeated allegations of corruption in power generation contracts won by mostly wind and solar power companies, Lopez Obrador said that while he remains open to dialogue with the companies, he also wants his aides to prepare the legal complaints against them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We want to talk to the companies one by one. At the same time, I've given the order to begin drawing up formal complaints," Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lopez Obrador, who has moved on several fronts to centralize more control over energy in state hands, alleged that after the private power firms won supply contracts at auction with state-run electricity company CFE that additional deals were inked that gave them preferential rates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He provided no evidence to support the allegation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since April, the government has sought to prevent more than 40 wind and solar power plants from connecting to the CFE-owned grid, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic requires an uninterrupted power supply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Critics have alleged that Lopez Obrador instead seeks to favor the CFE's mostly fossil fuel-derived power generation, and that he is generally suspicious of any private-sector participation in energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier this month, the president singled out Spain 's Iberdrola for criticism, accusing the power generation company of mounting a media campaign against his government as well as unspecified acts of graft.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Tuesday, Lopez Obrador did not mention any specific companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The power sector dispute directly affects more than $6 billion in partially or already built wind and solar power plants, which judges have allowed to proceed as planned despite the government push to stop them.

            <title>Things were tough in early June, now there is stability, says Manish Sisodia</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/things-were-tough-in-early-june-now-there-is-stability-says-manish-sisodia/ar-BB16alC2</link>
            <description> Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds temporary charge of the state health ministry, spoke to HT about where Delhi stands in&#60;p&#62;the Covid-19 fight, working with the Centre on formulating strategies, ramping up testing, the positivity rate, community transmission, home isolation, and the state's finances, among other issues. Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, we are in a comfortable situation. If you ask me about the peak, the time between June 8 and June 15, or rather the first two weeks of June, were a bit hard. We have seen stability after that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, when we were testing 5,000-6,000 people, about 2,000 were testing positive. Now, we are doing anywhere between 17,000 and 22,000 tests, and 3,000 are testing positive. This means there is stability in the number of cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If we look at the number of beds, the peak need was 6,200 beds. Now, it is close to 5,800-5,900this shows that there is stability in the number of beds needed. Deaths are also under control; not a huge spike.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Considering the character of this virus and what we are seeing across the globe, it will be wrong if I conclude that we will no longer see those jerks or spikes again. This phase, which I am calling a stable one, might be temporary phase, which is why surveillance and surveys, which are currently happening in the city, are very important.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What I said back then was the ground reality of the time. Now, whether the decision to share the projection of Covid cases with the public was right or wrong is very subjective. My viewpoint is that by throwing the numbers out in the open, a sense of urgency came in all of us, including the Centre. It is because of that alert that all stakeholders, including the central government, our government, NGOs and municipal corporations, came together. I feel sharing data with the public always proves to be beneficial.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; These projections were made based on a formula given by the government of India (GoI), which has created a portal for this, and that is what we're following. The projection of the total number of cases at present is not very different from the projection of 1 lakh cases by June-end that we had made back then. But other numbers are very different now. For example, we had then projected that active cases would be around 60,000 by now, but at present, we have only around 26,000 active cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No, today also we are doing all arrangements based on the same assessment made in the beginning of June. Our target was to prepare 15,000 beds. We have that today. We also have more than enough beds in quarantine centres. There are more than 8,500 quarantine beds ready, and only over 1,700 of them are currently occupied.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We were expecting that over 15,000 beds would be required, but now only around 5,900 beds are being utilised. In between, bed occupancy had peaked at 6,200 but things have improved since then.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At present, there are some signs of stability with the recovery rate improving and the positivity rate declining. This stability gives us hope, but we cannot be under the illusion that no more preparation is required.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The good thing is that Delhi's recovery rate is very promising. Today's recovery rate is 63.3%. This has helped us build confidence among the people in the chief minister's five weapons to fight Corona. Testing is being scaled up, and based on that, symptomatic cases are being isolated. More beds than what is required are being set up. The fourth is plasma therapy, which has shown positive results in Delhi. And the last one is survey and screening.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I agree that ventilators are the need of the hour, which is why I just took a meeting to review this matter, and we are working to augment it further. The central government has also helped us in this, but we are also procuring machines on our own. Every major Delhi government hospital has also been asked to chalk out a plan on how their capacity can be increased further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I stand by what the chief minister said yesterday - credit sara unka, zaroorat saari humari (credit all theirs, need all ours).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One good thing is that with the Centre's help, we have got some staff now in our dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We have got staff from ITBP who are manning the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and hospital. At present, they have given staff for 1,000 beds, but I hope they will provide more personnel for all the 10,000 beds when they are utilised. Besides, we have got some oxygen cylinders, ventilators and rail coaches from the Centre.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But this pandemic is so unprecedented that if any government or stakeholder claims that the situation was stabilised solely because of them, it would be too much. The good thing today is that all three - the Central government, the Delhi government and civil society - are working together in good coordination with each other. This is not the time to do post-mortems on who failed or passed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Difference of opinion is always there, and it is natural. There were some decisions taken by them (Central government and the Lieutenant-Governor), which we opposed in our discussions with them. We even kept our view in the public forum, sought views, and they withdrew those decisions. But, these things keep happening. It is a part of the process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, in our hospitals, we are bypassing all government processes to appoint medical staff on an immediate basis. All our medical directors have been authorised or empowered to create posts and fill them. We have decentralised the system, which has helped a lot. The municipal corporations are doing their bit in conducting surveys.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, MHA has not given us any standard operating procedure (SOP) on how this is to be done. This was recommended by the Centre's expert committee headed by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog. Once we get the SOP, then we will discuss it with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have issued a tender to rope in a private firm so that the follow-up process of home isolation patients is outsourced like before. In the meantime, we are trying to cope with whatever resources we have. We have put our staff from mohalla clinics and teams of district surveillance officers on the job as of now. But this is not sufficient.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are again going to outsource the tele-counselling task to a private firm. Which company gets the job will be known once the tender process is over. It will be finalised in a day or two.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; They (Centre) have asked for the data; we provided it. Now, pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators are also available; this has made home isolation a great solution. So far, more than 52,000 people have recovered.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the beginning of June, there were some issues - there were times when it took two-three hours for the admission of patients; now it takes a maximum of 10 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Centre said in the past that deaths happening in first one to three days of hospital admission implied that home isolation protocols were not being followed strictly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If a person is eligible for home isolation as per ICMR protocols - we have not set up our own protocols - it is much better if they stay at home rather than going to the Covid centres.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If someone needs hospitalisation, there is zero compromise on our end and from our medical teams. After reaching the hospitals, yes, there were some issues at the beginning. Now, the app is working really well and all the problems have been rectified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I feel that a lot of things will become clear after the sero surveillance study is done.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, 20% of the cases were reported from containment areas, 40% from clusters, and almost 40% were isolated cases. Now the clusters have also been included in the containment zones. That's why the increase in the number of zones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Actually, when you confirm community transmission, then rather than contact tracing, you focus on facilitating medical care. We are already doing that. But, yes, the resource and manpower that is focused on containment and tracing will no longer be a worry if you accept community transmission.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, we need to understand that Delhi is not a small city. In the same city, there could be a colony where community transmission could be ongoing but another colony in the same city might be very less affected. You cannot have the same yardstick for both. In a city like Delhi, you will still have to have multiple strategies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Every day, we are doing up to 20,000 tests. The main benefit is that we have been able to scale up testing. There is a limit to RT-PCR testing. That is why we are purchasing 5 lakh more tests so that we can increase it more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the benefit of rapid testing -- you can do it at a large scale. You cannot scale up RT-PCR to that level.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are moving towards 40,000 tests a day. And, the day we do that, it is possible that 4,000 people will test positive, I am prepared for that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No. Our collection for the first quarter of last year was 7,275 crore. This year it is approximately 2,500 crore only. So, our collection has been just one-third compared to last year. And, this is only GST and VAT. Excise, registry, and car sales have also stopped - that data has not been included in this. Total revenue in these categories must be only about 10% of the usual revenue.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since there is so much cooperation going on, and the Union home minister is also doing such handholding, I hope he will help us in this regard as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for 5,000 crore, but we are yet to hear from her. If we get this money - and I hope the Centre will give it - along with the GST compensation, then we can manage easily.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let us see. It is very difficult for me to say what the situation will be in July or August. The Government of India also said yesterday that schools will remain closed. We had assessed this a few days ago and announced our decision. It will take time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sign on to read the HT ePaper&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Spain closes half its coal-fired power stations</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/spain-closes-half-its-coal-fired-power-stations/76721436</link>
            <description> The move comes 18 months after Spain closed down its last coal mines, although the country remains behind on its drive to embrace renewable energies&#60;p&#62;Madrid: Spain on Tuesday shut down eight of its 15 coal-fired power stations on grounds they were unprofitable and in order to comply with European regulations on industrial emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The move comes 18 months after Spain closed down its last coal mines, although the country remains behind on its drive to embrace renewable energies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also came as experts said that coal had reached its economic "tipping point" meaning it was cheaper to build renewable energy sources than to continue operating coal-fired power stations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"It is cheaper (today) to produce (energy) with renewables than with coal," explained Ana Barreira, head of the International Institute for Law and the Environment (IIDMA)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;She said the remaining power stations could be closed down by 2025.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The decision was taken by the four Spanish electricity companies that own them -- Naturgy, Iberdrola, Viesgo and Endesa, a Spanish subsidiary of Italy's Enel group -- all of whom confirmed the closures.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The aim was to avoid the cost of bringing them up to date to comply with a European directive on cleaning up their emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Unlike in France or Germany, the Spanish government never set a date by which such facilities were to have closed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These power stations collectively generated 5.16 gigawatts (GW) of power, and their closure will halve Spain's coal-fired output, reducing it to 4.7 gigawatts, the "Coal-Free Future" coalition said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;June 30 was the last day of a transition period for such plants to comply with a European directive on industrial emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The firms chose not to make the necessary investments because they were "no longer profitable," said Greenpeace 's Tatiana Nuno, saying the move had been in line with market demands.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Most of these plants had hardly produced any electricity in the past few months, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In 2019, coal only represented 5.0 percent of Spain's total energy consumption, compared with 25 percent in 2007, the Red Electrica power grid said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But Spain remains far from meeting its commitment to green its energy sources, with only 17.4 percent of the total coming from renewables in 2018, the latest available Eurostat figures show.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It had committed to raising that number to 20 percent by 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Spain had been one of the pioneers of green energy back in the early 2000s, but its lightning development was slowed by the financial crisis that kicked off in 2008.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In recent years, there has been increasing appetite for investment in green energy given the profitability of renewables, with the development of huge solar parks and Spain now ranking the fifth in the world in terms of wind power installations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Is Your Hair Thinning Due To Hard Water? Here's How To Fix That</title>
            <link>https://www.idiva.com/beauty/hair/how-to-prevent-hair-fall-caused-by-hard-water/18010902</link>
            <description> "Hard water is a mineral-rich type of water which many of us unknowingly use on the daily. It leaves a slightly soapy feeling in the hair, and is filled with minerals which leave deposits on our scalp and in our strands of hair.  This happens because rainwater seeps through different kinds of rocks when stored underground, and therefore contains minerals from those. Usually the minerals are magnesium, calcium, and sulphates. These salts, while not harmful in general, are bad for hair.   Hard water can cause hair damage and breakage, but not permanent hair loss What hard water does when it reacts with the surfactants in shampoo, is it forms chemicals which stick to the scalp and strands. Scalp calcification is often a side effect of shampooing with hard water, which means your scalp gets coated with calcium carbonate. This prevents the follicles from getting the nutrients they need. Not only that, the minerals in hard water can sit on the scalp and cause eczema, which irritates the scalp and causes flaking. Since this is literally the root from which your hair grows, hair thinning is related to scalp health.

Hard water is bad for hair strands, too. The coating of minerals prevents moisture from entering the cuticles and keeping them nourished. So, hair gets dry and frizzy. Thats not all. A lot of the products you use might also become less effective after reacting with the minerals in this water. Your hair colour also fades or becomes brassy. Hair feels and looks flat and weighed down, too. All in all, hard water is not good for hair, and that needs to be remedies if you want luscious locks.   Hard water is alkaline, which can be neutralised with acidic rinses using ACV  Image credits: Pixabay  Hard water is basic or alkaline in terms of its pH. This means it needs to be neutralised with something acidic to be neutral. Apple cider vinegar is a great way to soften water meant to be used for rinsing your hair because this is a hair-friendly ingredient that also happens to be purifying for the scalp. So, you can either do an apple cider vinegar rinse to clear the mineral buildup in your hair, or you can get an apple cider vinegar shampoo.  Using the right shampoo is important if youre experiencing hairfall due to hard water Most websites recommend using clarifying shampoos to cope with hard water deposits, but there is a caveat to that one must keep in mind: avoid shampoos containing SLS. SLS makes hair drier because it strips hair of natural oils, but its still commonly used in products because it creates a lot of foam and lather. Now, if you have hard water issues, the last thing you need is more harsh, soapy chemicals, so its important to ditch the SLS and go sulphate-free when youre choosing a clarifying shampoo.  The Wow Skin Science Hard Water Defense Shampoo, worth Rs 499, is specifically made for such problems, and contains ingredients which are moisturising for hair.   Image credits: WOW Skin Science  A tad more expensive at Rs 635, the L'oreal Professionnel Serie Expert Pure Resource Shampoo is specially formulated to be used with hard water, and is great for oily and greasy hair.   Image credits: LOreal  The last solution is changing the water by installing a soft water filter You do get purifying filters to put on your taps and pipes in order to turn hard water soft, so that goes a long way in making sure you arent using hard water in the first place. These filters are usually shower filters and tap filters.&#60;br&#62;Loreal Professionel"</description>

            <description> A new report highlights challenges and opportunities for India's transition to clean mobility and power systems in the context of COVID-19 NEW&#60;p&#62;DELHI, June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report by NITI Aayog, Government of India's premier think tank, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), and RMI India discusses how COVID-19 is influencing the clean energy transition in India, as well as identifying principles and strategic opportunities to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy. Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities for India's Energy and Mobility Sectors advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts including electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. "India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers," he said. "Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness," said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. "We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhousesthe transport and power sectorsand emerge stronger." The report lays out four principles as a framework to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives," said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. "As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air." The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector.

            <title>Kessler Topaz Meltzer &#38; Check, LLP Announces A Securities Fraud Class Action Filed Against Ideanomics, Inc.</title>
            <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kessler-topaz-meltzer-check-llp-020100369.html</link>
            <description> RADNOR, Pa. June 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer &#38; Check, LLP alerts investors that a securities fraud class action&#60;p&#62;lawsuit has been filed against Ideanomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDEX) ("Ideanomics") on behalf of those who purchased or otherwise acquired Ideanomics common stock between March 20, 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; and June 25, 2020 , inclusive (the "Class Period").&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; More&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Ideanomics common stock during the Class Period may, no later than August 27, 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; , seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please click https://www.ktmc.com/ideanomics-inc-class-action?utm_source=PR&#38;utm_medium=link&#38;utm_campaign=ideanomics&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to the complaint, Ideanomics is a global company focused on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles ("EV") and developing next generation financial services and Fintech products.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Class Period commences on March 20, 2020 , when Ideanomics issued a press release in which it announced "that the Qingdao-MEG Sales Center, branded as Mobile Energy Group Center, is scheduled to start sales operations by May 1 ." Throughout the Class Period, Ideanomics continued to laud its EV expo center, claiming the MEG Center is "the largest auto trading market in Qingdao China . However, the truth was eventually revealed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to the complaint, on June 25, 2020 , analyst Hindenburg Research issued a series of tweets in which it called Ideanomics "an egregious &#38; obvious fraud." Hindenburg asserted that it found evidence that Ideanomics had doctored photos for use in its press releases to suggest that it owns or operates a vehicle sales center in Qingdao, China , when it in fact does not. Hindenburg further asserted that it had an investigator go to Ideanomics' purported MEG Center in Qingdao, China , where the investigator was unable to find any trace of Ideanomics or its purported MEG Center. Also, on June 25, 2020 , analyst J Capital Research issued a report on Ideanomics entitled "Champion of Promotes". J Capital Research wrote, in part, that "Ideanomics . . . is a zero. The company changes its name and promotional story so frequently that it's hard to keep up. One thing remains a constant, despite all the press releases, buzzwords and hype: shareholders get wiped out." J Capital Research continued, in a tweet, that "[w]e called all the 'buyers' named in [Ideanomics'] press releases this month. Not a single one had made a purchase. One of them thanked us for alerting them to 'fake news.'" Following this news, Ideanomics' stock price fell from its June 24, 2020 close of to a June 25, 2020 close of per share, a one day drop of or approximately 21%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Then, on June 26, 2020 , Ideanomics issued a press release in which it sought to "clarify the status" of its purported EV hub in Qingdao, China . In this release, Ideanomics walked back certain of its prior statements regarding the MEG Center in Qingdao , stating that it was launching three phases of its MEG Center that will eventually total one million square feet. The first phase, according to Ideanomics, occupies only 215,000 square feet. Following this news, the stock price continued to fall on June 26, 2020 , dropping to a close of per share. This represents a two day drop of approximately 53%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Ideanomics' MEG Center in Qingdao was not "a one million square foot EV expo center"; (ii) Ideanomics had been using doctored or altered photographs of the purported MEG Center in Qingdao ; (iii) Ideanomics' EV business in China was not performing nearly as strong as Ideanomics had represented; and (iv) as a result, Ideanomics' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ideanomics investors who wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer &#38; Check, LLP ( James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq. ) at (844) 877-9500 (toll free) or at info@ktmc.com&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ideanomics investors may, no later than August 27, 2020 , seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer &#38; Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Kessler Topaz Meltzer &#38; Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law.

            <title>Creating Alignment in the 5G Ecosystem</title>
            <link>https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/creating-alignment-in-the-5g-ecosystem/</link>
            <description> July 2020 The theme for the 45th US-India Business Councils webinar, organized by US Chamber of Commerce on June 29, 2020 was Creating Alignment in the 5G Ecosystem.&#60;p&#62;With Rajan Mathews, DG, COAI coordinating, the panel comprised of senior business leaders with impressive credentials, who as expected made powerful presentations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As always, its great to be with the USIBC. You were one of the first groups I spoke to as FCC Chairman back in early 2017. At that meeting, I said that the partnership between the United States and India will be the defining one of the 21st century. Over the past three-plus years, its been gratifying to see the bonds between the U.S. and India grow stronger and stronger.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We saw the vitality of this special friendship on full display this past February. I was honored and humbled to be a part of the U.S. delegation visiting India. From my bilateral visits with my counterparts in the Indian government to the state banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan and conversations with Prime Minister Modi, the energy and excitement was incredible. The trip left me with an even deeper appreciation of the common values our countries share and an even stronger determination to help bring the worlds oldest and largest democracies even closer together.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The United States and India share not only a set of common values. We also share strategic interests. We are both deeply committed to harnessing the power of communications technology to promote mutual growth and prosperity for our people. And we both deeply value the importance of connecting all of our citizens. That means, in part, unlocking the power and potential of 5G technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I commend the USIBC for launching this Webinar series on 5G, and I appreciate the opportunity to be the first speaker of the first session.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ive been asked to begin with an update on the FCCs efforts to promote the development and deployment of 5G. This is something weve spent quite some time on, to say the least.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We call our strategy the 5G FAST plan, and it has three key components: freeing up spectrum, promoting wireless infrastructure, and modernizing regulations to encourage fiber deployment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With respect to spectrum, the Commission has left no stone unturned in its quest to make a mix of low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum available for 5G services. Earlier this year, we concluded an auction of 3,400 megahertz of spectrum in the upper 37, 39 and 47 GHz bands, the most spectrum ever won in a single auction. In 2019, we auctioned 850 megahertz in the 28 GHz band, and 700 megahertz in the 24 GHz band. Combined, these three auctions made available almost five gigahertz of high-band spectrum for commercial use. To put that in perspective, that is more spectrum than was used for terrestrial mobile broadband by all wireless service providers in the United States combined before these auctions started.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lately, our focus has been on mid-band spectrum, which is appealing for 5G because it combines good geographic coverage with good capacity. Weve got a lot of efforts moving forward on this fronttoo many for me to coverbut the one I would highlight is our work on the so-called C-band. The C-band is a 500-megahertz swath of spectrum from 3.7 GHz to 4.2 GHz. Its mostly used by fixed-satellite companies to beam content to video and audio broadcasters, cable systems, and other content distributors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Four months ago, the FCC voted to clear the lower 280 megahertz of the C-band and make this spectrum available for flexible use. To that end, well begin a public auction this coming December 8. All eligible space station operators currently using this spectrum have committed to an accelerated relocation to the upper 200 megahertz of this bandmeaning that the lower 280 megahertz (and a 20-megahertz guard band) will become available for 5G two to four years earlier than otherwise would have been the case.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In addition to pushing more spectrum out in the marketplace, we continue to clear regulatory hurdles and promote infrastructure build-out. This has spurred record-breaking capital investments in infrastructure essential for 5G, including fiber-optic cables and small cells.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now, when we say we want to accelerate the deployment of 5G, were effectively saying that we want high-speed, high-throughput mobile connectivity to be available to everyone, everywhere. But 5G isnt the only technology with the power to create this world of ubiquitous wireless gigabit connectivity. While many new technologies are emerging, such as high-throughput GEO and LEO satellite systems as well as ATSC 3.0, our biggest initiative of late involved Wi-Fispecifically, our decision to make available the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Wi-Fi already carries more than half of the Internets traffic. And offloading mobile data traffic to Wi-Fi was vital to keeping our cellular networks from being overwhelmed over the past few months. The exciting news is that Wi-Fi 6, the next generation of Wi-Fi, has already started rolling out. Wi-Fi 6 will be over two-and-a-half times faster than the current standard, and it will offer better performance for connected devices. But in order to fully take advantage of the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, we need to make more mid-band spectrum available for unlicensed use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And thats exactly what the FCC did on April 23. The Commission unanimously approved my proposal to make the entire 6 GHz band available for unlicensed use. By doing this, we are creating a massive 1200-megahertz testbed for innovators and innovation. This is a big deal. Weve effectively increased the amount of mid-band spectrum available for Wi-Fi by almost a factor of five.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All 1,200 megahertz of this spectrum will be available for indoor-only low-power use without the added complexity of database coordination. We are also making the two largest sub-band segments, totaling 850 megahertz, available for use indoors and outdoors at a higher standard power. Well use an automated frequency coordination system to prevent interference with incumbent services. Going big means allowing unprecedented use. To put that in perspective, that is more spectrum than was used for terrestrial mobile broadband by all wireless service providers in the United States combined before these auctions started.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lately, our focus has been on mid-band spectrum, which is appealing for 5G because it combines good geographic coverage with good capacity.

We are also making the two largest sub-band segments, totaling 850 megahertz, available for use indoors and outdoors at a higher standard power. Well use an automated frequency coordination system to prevent interference with incumbent services. Going big means allowing unprecedented&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;160- and 320-megahertz channels for Wi-Fi. This will dramatically ease spectrum capacity as a constraint on innovation and open the door to new high-bandwidth applications.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ultimately, I expect that 6 GHz unlicensed devices will become a part of consumers everyday lives. And I predict the rules we adopted in April will play a major role in the growth of the Internet of Things, connecting appliances, machines, meters, wearables, smart televisions, and other consumer electronics, as well as industrial sensors for manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During my visit to India in February, I had a good discussion with Indian officials about our 6 GHz efforts, so I know that India is interested in exploring the possibilities of unlicensed use in this band. Im eager to work with my Indian counterparts and other leaders around the world to harness the benefits of the 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi and then work together toward global harmonization of this spectrum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ultimately, I think Wi-Fi 6 and 5G will complement each other nicely and form a powerful 1-2 punch of licensed and unlicensed innovation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To this point, Ive talked about how everybody wants next-generation wireless networks that are ultra-fast, high-capacity, and widely available. One more thing well demand of tomorrows networks is that they must be secure. When 5G is embedded in almost every aspect of our society and economyfrom businesses to homes, hospitals to transportation networks, manufacturing to the power gridthat means securing our networks will become much more important and much more difficult. An important part of network security is the integrity of the communications supply chainthat is, the process by which products and services are manufactured, distributed, sold, and ultimately integrated into our communications networks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For years, U.S. government officials have expressed concern about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment providers. Hidden backdoors to our networks in routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow hostile foreign powers to inject viruses and other malware, steal Americans private data, spy on U.S. companies, and more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The equipment at the heart of 5G networks currently comes from just a few global suppliers. And the largest right now is the Chinese company Huawei. This has raised concerns, given that Chinese law requires all companies subject to its jurisdiction to comply with requests from the countrys intelligence services, and bars disclosure of these requests to any third parties.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To counter this risk, the FCC has prohibited the use of money from our Universal Service Fund to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat. We have also initiated a process to catalog, remove, and replace unsecure equipment from USF-funded communications networks. Weve denied authorization to China Mobile to enter the U.S. market. And weve issued show-cause orders to Chinese state-owned companies that already had received such authorizations. Finally, Congress recently passed, and the President signed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act to further strengthen the integrity of communications networks and the communications supply chain. On July 16, the FCC will vote to start the process for implementing that law.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Im not the only panelist who believes that, when it comes to 5G, we cannot afford to make risky choices and just hope for the best. Under Mathew Oommens leadership, Reliance Jio will not be using Huaweis equipment in its 5G networks. I applaud Mathew for his leadership on this issue. The more that allies in the United States and India can work together and make security decisions based on shared principles, the safer that our 5G networks will be.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On that note, Ill wrap it up. Thanks again to USIBC for convening this forum. I look forward to todays discussion and to working with you in the days ahead to seize the opportunities of 5G and expand digital opportunity across the United States and India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajen Vagadia, Vice President &#38; President, Qualcomm India &#38; SAARC&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The knowledge coming from the US on 5G is very useful. There is growing proximity between India and US, and its interesting to see India exporting handsets to the US and going forward, we see the transfer of knowledge and expertise on network side from the US to India, its going to be two-way transactions in this relationship.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is not looking at 5G only for cellular networks, the background work which is happening currently is immense, in terms of architecture planning particularly and covers a large spectrum of possibilities, even despite that the 5G auctions are yet nowhere in the horizon.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Qualcomm has been in India since 26 years. We understand India fairly deep and have a large presence in India. I am confident that as and when the frequencies are available in India, we will have the devices ready. We are fully equipped and I do not see any challenges as and when the spectrum is available in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Im not the only panelist who believes that, when it comes to 5G, we cannot afford to make risky choices and just hope for the best. Under Mathew Oommens leadership, Reliance Jio will not be using Huaweis equipment in its 5G networks. I applaud Mathew for his leadership on this issue. The more that allies in the United States and India can work together and make security decisions based on shared principles, the safer that our 5G networks will be.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On that note, Ill wrap it up.

            <title>Decoding the app ban: Growth plans go astray for Chinese firms</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/in-depth/decoding-the-app-ban-growth-plans-go-astray-for-chinese-firms/ar-BB16bdl4</link>
            <description> The comprehensive ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps leaves the flourishing app economy in a state of disarray in the midst of a heightened sense of nationalism following the India-China standoff.&#60;p&#62; The ban has wide-ranging implications for companies who own these apps; thousands of employees of these firms, besides an energetic breed of content creators and influencers who practically now suffer a 'career setback'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Therefore, let's begin with the legality of the ban and if the government has got all aspects covered. According to experts, in terms of legal and constitutional competencies, the government seems to be on a sticky wicket.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) order issued on Monday doesn't talk about specific evidence of violation in the order. It will have to be brought forward in case the ban is legally challenged, which is very likely.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The order talks about "misuse of some mobile apps on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This issue is particularly tricky because India still doesn't have the Data Protection Act in place which specifically deals with such issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also, on the issue of privacy concerns raised in the MeitY order, there are no laws that specifically deal with it unless the government intends to refer to the 2017 order of the Supreme Court on the right to privacy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "There are no proper laws in areas like data protection and privacy. To implement cyber laws, there's no specific regulator. It's under everybody's jurisdiction, be it police, NITI Aayog, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), home ministry, and others," says Virag Gupta, a cyber lawyer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While the legality of the ban will take its time to unfold, what will be the immediate impact of the ban on the companies who own these apps, and Chinese investment in India?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The ban on these apps will not only impact the popularity of these apps but also the valuation of their parent companies. For instance, TikTok which is one of the most popular apps in India with more than 200 million users, has witnessed 30.3% of its total downloads from this country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ByteDance was also planning to invest $1 billion in India and hire 1,000 people. Additionally there are talks about an IPO for ByteDance that is valued at more than $100 billion. But, in the larger scheme of things, the ban will have very little impact on Chinese investments in India. That is because a lot of Indian startups operate on funds from big Chinese investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to a report by thinktank Gateway House, as many as 18 of the 30 unicorns in India are backed by Chinese investors. Tech titans, the BAT companies - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - as they are called in China, are also a significant part of these investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Paytm, Zomato, Byju's, Ola, Flipkart, Swiggy, OYO, Delhivery, Practo, Rivigo, MakeMyTrip, Big-Basket, Hike are some of the big home-grown companies to have Chinese investments. There are many others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Beyond the companies who own these apps, the worst hit due to the ban is the influencer community on TikTok. Influencers who were born on TikTok and didn't expand their presence across other social media platforms are likely to be hurt the most.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, those who had a presence across Instagram, YouTube amongst others, will be able to channelise their campaigns and continue to earn.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Content creators will also face monetary losses since brands have already started putting their planned TikTok activities in pause mode for now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The platform was used for influencer engagement. Given the massive fan following most influencers enjoyed, brands were engaging with them directly for promotion. I see those rates dropping down significantly now," says Nimesh Shah, Head Maven, Windchimes Communications.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Industry experts believe that while there are no clear guidelines or clarity on the current situation, brands should quickly complete planned commitments with an additional post on linked channels such as Instagram.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Once the platform is not accessible, all the scheduled campaigns from the brands will be on pause until further clarity from the government.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmender Pradhan, LG Anil Baijal and SDMC functionaries participated in the MoU signing event through a video link&#60;p&#62;New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will use the Okhla landfill site s garbage to produce syn gas a hydrogen-based fuel  which will be later used to generate electricity. An MoU to set up a pilot project with a capacity to treat 50 tonnes of garbage per day was signed between the civic body, Indian Oil and NTPC on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the project will help in addressing the problem of garbage disposal. The plant will process 50 tonnes per day of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) segregated from municipal solid waste to produce syn gas which will be used to generate about 1 MW electricity, Bharti added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The municipal corporation will provide 1 acre of land at the Okhla site on lease to Indian Oil for setting up the processing plant. SDMC will also purchase the power generated from the plant. We will be able to save Rs 2.6 crores due to the purchase of power from the plant, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmender Pradhan, LG Anil Baijal and SDMC functionaries participated in the MoU signing event through a video link.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indian Oil and NTPC will make an investment of 50 per cent each towards the capital cost involved in setting up the plant through a consortium. Indian Oil will facilitate the technology and handle the whole operation of the proposed plant, while NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation, said a civic official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This plant is an indigenous solution to solid waste problem and will help SDMC in achieving 100 per cent waste processing. We will try to replicate the plan in other areas in future, said Anamika, south Delhi mayor.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union minister Pradhan added that Delhi generates 10,000 tonnes of waste every day and it is a challenge to manage and process the entire quantity. Such plants will go a long way in production of enriched organic manure, generation of electricity and treatment of effluent water, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LG Anil Baijal said that such innovative undertakings will definitely reduce accumulation of municipal solid waste at landfill sites and will pave way for remediation of legacy waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said the proposed plant is an example of two ministries coming together for a good public cause just the way the prime minister talks about breaking silos.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Synthesised gas is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which acts as a clean fuel. This project is based on clean technology and no pollution will be caused, added the civic official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Tesla Inc turns 17: Take a look at Elon Musk's life and his weird decisions over the years</title>
            <link>https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/article/tesla-inc-turns-17-take-a-look-at-elon-musks-life-and-his-weird-decisions-over-the-years/614476</link>
            <description> Tesla Boss Elon Musk has come to symbolise technological genius, daring entrepreneurship and also weird behaviour that shocks all. Take a look at the brave, bizarre, bold moves Musk has made over the years.&#60;p&#62;Tesla Motors Inc, now simply Tesla Inc, (the electric vehicle manufacturer) was founded on 1 July 2003 in Palo Alto, California by American engineers and entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Wait, what? Not founded by Elon Musk, is what most people will ask since the company's name is now synonymous with that of its enigmatic and haphazard boss, Elon Musk - the famous entrepreneur-engineer-designer who was born in South Africa.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In fact, Eberhard's appointment as Teslas first CEO was made by the chairman of the board who was Elon Musk - the man to provide almost all the funding to get the company off the ground after the founders were inspired by GM scrapping its EV1 electric car programme. Musk joined Tesla Motors, Inc. in 2004, the year after it was founded.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here's taking a look at Tesla's boss Elon Musk and the weird things associated with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The views expressed by the author are personal and do not in any way represent those of Times Network.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Indian private firms seen developing 15 million tonnes capacity coal mines this year: Coal minister</title>
            <link>https://www.cnbctv18.com/india/indian-private-firms-seen-developing-15-million-tonnes-capacity-coal-mines-this-year-coal-minister-6236421.htm</link>
            <description> India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's consumption of coal fell 3.3 percent to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency Moody's Indian unit ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9 percent between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7 percent this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Indian ministries want to limit public consultations that are necessary before approving projects</title>
            <link>https://www.ucnews.in/news/Indian-ministries-want-to-limit-public-consultations-that-are-necessary-before-approving-projects/33811021247986.html</link>
            <description> Following in the footsteps of the coal ministry, which secured exemption from public hearings for capacity expansion of coal mines by up to 40%, the Union Ministry of Mines has now sought a similar exemption for non-coal mining projects.&#60;p&#62;Though it has not yet recommended such an exemption, an expert panel of the environment ministry has asked the mines ministry to justify the exemption, after which it will make a decision. However, the exemption, if given, is expected to be controversial as the one given to the coal ministry has already been facing a legal challenge. The issue was discussed during the June 12 meeting of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Changes Expert Appraisal Committee of non-coal mining projects.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The minutes of the Expert Appraisal Committee meeting noted that the Ministry of Mines has requested that non-coal mining projects involving increase in production capacity up to 40% may also be exempted from the requirement of public hearing subject to conditions deemed necessary.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In July 2017, another Expert Appraisal Committee, in a recommendation for coal mining projects, said, exemption from public hearing while considering grant of environmental clearances to the expansion projects of coal mines, involving increase in production capacity up to 40% in two [to] three phases after the due diligence and subject to fulfilment of certain requirements.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Following this, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in September 2017 approved the recommendation, allowing coal mine expansion up to 40% of capacity if there is no increase in area for the proposed expansion. It had also held that such an expansion can be allowed if mineral transport is through conveyor system up to the silo and loading to railway wagons, and not by road.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During the June 12 meeting, the MoEFCC briefed the expert panel that the same conditions on which such an exemption was allowed to the coal ministry may not be relevant to the non-coal mining projects. Therefore, the ministry decided to refer the matter to the EAC non-coal mining sector for deliberation and recommendation of certain requirements which would be relevant and implementable in non-coal mining projects, noted the minutes of the EACs June 12 meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Public hearings are a requirement under the environment clearance process under which people of an area affected by any project, whether infrastructure or mining, put forward their concerns about a particular project. These hearings are attended by officials of the company doing the project as well as officials of the pollution control board of that state. The concerns raised in these hearings are then recorded and the expert committees of the environment ministry during their meetings could seek the project proponents reply to such concerns.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;An exemption from public hearings for their existing projects would help industries speed up the process of expansion. However, the concern is that expansion of a project up to 40 percent is a substantial increase and doing away of the public hearing process in these cases could mean ecological concerns of locals may not be addressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the Ministry of Mines, India has huge resources of minerals and the mining sector is an important segment of the Indian economy. The country produces at least 87 minerals, which includes four fuel, 10 metallic, 47 non-metallic, three atomic and 23 minor minerals  including building and other materials. As per the official data, the value of mineral production in India has increased spectacularly in the last 60 years and in 2015-16 is about Rs 2.82 trillion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Flouting international commitments&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Environmental lawyer Rahul Choudhary said the implications of a decision to omit public hearings for mining expansions would be significant considering the impact it would have on communities living around such mines and their livelihoods. It will also have impacts on forests and on the environment, including the increased pollution load. He stressed that there are many cases of mines not complying with conditions given in the environment clearance and expansion of 40% is a substantial increase.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Public hearing was included in the environment impact assessment process keeping in mind the countrys international commitment. Now, if we take such a decision, it will mean backtracking on our international climate commitments. If we ignore and circumvent public participation in the process, then what kind of democracy are we even talking about, Choudhary toldMongabay-India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided, notes the Principle 10, adopted in 1992 as a part of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which India is a signatory.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Impact on ecology&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the June 12 meeting, the expert panel was briefed about the major differences in coal and non-coal mining, like mining areas for coal are mostly valleys while for non-coal minerals they are hillocks. It also highlighted that the majority of the non-coal mines are located away from the habitation and hence the impact of emissions on the habitation is lower compared to coal mines.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The expert panel considered the arguments and held that the proposals in the non-coal mining sector is unlike coal mining, diverse in nature in respect of shallow deposits; deep-seated deposits; the magnitude of mining; major minerals, minor minors, strategic minerals, replenish deposits, etc. It also noted that the coal mines are generally operated by the public sector units and big corporates, whereas the non-coal mines, the operators are of very wide range including government, PSUs and private, therefore the infrastructure and organisation structure available is unlike coal mining.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Given these factors, the Expert Appraisal Committee was of the view that it cannot discriminate the minerals but noted that public hearing is a major concern for any new or expansion activity and asked for a comprehensive proposal. It held that in case the ministry of mines submits a detailed proposal including justification the matter can be further deliberated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also noted that there were litigations filed before the Supreme Court on the one-time capacity permissions issued in the coal mining.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Himachal Pradesh-based independent environment researcher Meenakshi Kapoor said non-coal minerals are found in diverse areas across the country. For instance, several strategic and rare minerals are found in coastal areas while others like bauxite are in forest areas. Similarly, unsustainable sand mining is seriously harming river ecology. It seems that the MoEFCC is just a clearance house now. First, it was the coal ministry and now the mines ministry wants this exemption for the entire mining sector. It is being forgotten that there is a 2009 advisory by the environment ministry to its expert appraisal committees that stated that the exemptions from the public hearing for expansion projects should be given judiciously and reasons be recorded. While reasons are recorded, good judgment is barely applied. This is simply bizarre, Kapoor toldMongabay-India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;She emphasised that what needs to be understood is that there are serious impacts depending on the nature of mining projects. For instance, look at Goa where excessive iron ore mining has triggered landslides and change in water drainage patterns in addition to extreme dust pollution. Moreover, such expansions, even if without any increase in pollution load [how will that be made possible is another matter!] and additional land takeover, cause a severe strain on existing natural resources and local ecology, Kapoor said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Indias private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year, Mr Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The countrys consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Mr Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Withdraw RBI power to oversee state co-op banks, Mamata tells PM</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/withdraw-rbi-power-to-oversee-state-co-op-banks-mamata-tells-pm-6484402/</link>
            <description> Banerjee said the latest trail of devastation was a reminder of the need for a "systematic review of the multiple challenges faced by the Sunderbans, and calls for a scientifically designed development package for its protection and balanced socio-economic development.&#60;p&#62;In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her dissatisfaction with the Centres move to transfer the supervisory role of state cooperative banks from the state government to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So far, the RBI was overseeing the banks capital adequacy, risk control, and lending norms, while the management responsibilities were entrusted to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, which is a state government agency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the letter, Banerjee said the registrars supervisory role and management responsibilities should be restored. The Centres June 26 ordinance took away the government bodys supervisory powers in a unilateral manner, she added. The CM said the cooperative societies were a state subject, and the Centres move infringed upon the state governments powers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, Banerjee also wrote to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, requesting the formation of an interdisciplinary team to initiate preparations for a masterplan for the Sundarbans. The UNESCO World Heritage site has been wrecked by cyclones in recent years, the latest being Cyclone Amphan that made landfall on May 20.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the letter to Kumar, Banerjee said 50 lakh people live in the Sundarbans, and pointed out that it has the worlds largest single block of mangrove forests. The forests received the worst battering in living memory during Cyclone Amphan, she added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I would like to request NITI Aayog to kindly commission the preparation of a Master Plan by an interdisciplinary team of experts covering all aspects of socio-economic development of this ecologically fragile region, said the Chief Minister.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A central team had visited certain Amphan-ravaged villages in the Sunderbans in early June to assess the extensive damage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Banerjee said the latest trail of devastation was a reminder of the need for a systematic review of the multiple challenges faced by the Sunderbans, and calls for a scientifically designed development package for its protection and balanced socio-economic development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any review of the manifold challenges faced by the Sunderbans would require a pool of experts drawn from different disciplines, and technical assistance from international multilateral bodies, said the Chief Minister, adding, It will also require funding support from the government of India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;?

(Operator Instructions) I must advise that this conference is being recorded today.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And I would now like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Chairman, Tor Troim. Please.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tor Olav Tr&#195;&#184;im, Golar LNG Limited - Chairman of the Board [2]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thank you. Welcome to the first quarter call for Golar Partners. I just want to give a quick introduction before I give the words to our new Chief Executive, Karl Staubo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Q1 has been a challenging quarter for the company. We were well on the way to secure an attractive refinancing of the company, including the presentation of a structural transaction opportunity when the pandemic hit us and also the bond market. We are then forced to go into discussion with the bonders in order to amend and extend the existing $150 million and $250 million bond financing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thanks to the solid EBITDA generation in the company and the $2 billion in order backlog and a good dialogue with the [Board,] we managed to reach a constructive solution, which puts the debt at out at reasonable terms, including some amortization of the bond debt.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The rearrangement of the debt, including the increased amortization, led to a decision by the Board to cut the dividend by 95%. It's been a painful period for the shareholders, as you all understand, and I [sincerely] apologize for the lack of performance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, we also need to look forward, where do we stand as of today. With that solid operation we have and with $2 billion in order backlog and an EBITDA, net debt to leverage ratio of approximately 5, we are on solid footing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The result for the next 2 years are more or less secured through the fixed charters we have with some upside if you can find employment for Golar Spirit and Golar Mazo. We'll naturally reduce our debt significantly to close to $300 million in EBITDA. And I think it's a pretty good sign of a better future when officials from Cameroonian state of the company yesterday, stated to the press that they would like to keep Hilli in Cameroon after the current contract expire in 2026.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It tells us that we have a happy customer, which will add backlog and coverage to your order backlog. The reduction in gas and LNG prices over the last year has led to a movement of profitability from the upstream side of our -- from the downstream side.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are today in a situation where coal to gas, which is highly profitable, both from an environmental and financial point of view. The assets that our partners have are important enabler in this transformation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Through the use of FSUs, FSRUs, combined with [ISO containers] and small-scale power station, we can significantly reduce energy and transportation costs for consumers, and we can do it quickly. The revolution has started, and the economics are attractive for energy consumers. And we see that from the activity level we see in Golar Power these days, where we now do small-scale LNG distribution with enterprise value and EBITDA factor or less than 2.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is a rapid development, and I personally think it's likely that over the next years, we'll see things like floating power plants and floating data centers filed with LNG through use of the FSRU technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The lower the LNG prices are, the more compelling the cases are for our counterparties to do the switch and the more Golar valuable -- Golar Partners (inaudible) will be when the existing contracts are up for termination or renewal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sadly enough, it's the poorest countries in the world who pays most for power and energy, partly because of the political risk in building infrastructure in these countries. Power is, in many ways, the way of the poverty for these countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think the use of floating technology can be -- can reduce the risk significantly for going ahead, particularly on the African continent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I get inspiration when we several months ago sat with the President of one of the Latin America countries, presented a number to use an FSRU to anchor up a diesel to LNG conversion in his country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; After 5 minutes, he said that this is music in my ears, and he concluded the meeting by saying to the energy Minister, let's go. That's the kind of encouragement we didn't get 5 years ago. Prices and the proof of the concept, including the small-scale development through ISO containers is in the process of changing the slow speed of the LNG downstream. Golar Group has, as the only fully integrated LNG company, shown the way, and have given us credibility going forward. I'm not in any way proud of the performance of this company, but I'm proud of the platform, the employees have built, the consistency of the operation and the credibility we have with existing and potential new customers. Hopefully, we can convert that to create a better return to our shareholders in the years to come.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Enough about the fundamentals in our business, I want to leave the words to Karl Staubo to take you through the Q1 numbers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl has taken over from Graham Rob Don. I think performed something like 66 quarterly calls. So Karl has a big task to follow up on, but yes, a very solid background from the industry as well as from Golar, where he have worked largely with the company over the last 18 months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'll leave it to Karl.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [3]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thank you, Tor Olav. It's certainly big shoes to fill taking over this role from Graham with his more than 20 years of experience in the Golar Group, but I will certainly do my best.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So with that, I'll take the opportunity to welcome you to the Golar LNG Partners First Quarter 2020 Results. Please note the forward-looking statements on Page 2.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Page 3, I will quickly run through the recent highlights. We reported operating income of $27.7 million, excluding the ownership of the LNG Hilli.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have a quarterly net loss of $33.1 million after accounting for $46.8 million of noncash mark-to-market loss on interest rate swaps as an effect by the significant decline of LIBOR over the quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Distributable cash flow for the quarter is reported at $25.4 million, a distribution coverage ratio of 17.79x versus 1.21 in the previous quarter That's obviously due to the mentioned 95% cut in the quarterly distribution to unitholders that Tor Olav mentioned.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Golar Grand got extended for another year under its existing charter party from May 2020. And Golar Maria secured coverage for the majority of available days in the gap period between its existing charter coming off in April 2020 and the start of its next long-term charter or 2-year charter in Q2 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With the extension of Grand and filling the gap on Maria, we now have 3 or 4 LNG carriers, fully covered for the full year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bond holders approved an 18-month extension of the May 2020 and the May 2021 unsecured bond maturities. It was announced that I would replace Graham as CSO -- CEO as already discussed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And lastly, we declared the distribution for the first quarter of $0.0202, again, down 95%, as previously announced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Slide 4. These are our first quarter 2020 financial results. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $69.8 million, a decrease from Q4 '19 due to scheduled off-hire for Golar Igloo, idling of Golar Mazo and partly offset by chartering revenue on Gola Maria. Total operating expenses came in at $42 million up around $2 million from the last quarter due to maintenance work on the FSRU Igloo for the scheduled maintenance period in the two first months of the year. We also have a slightly higher OpEx due to a delay in reducing the crew on Golar Mazo in its lay-up due to COVID-19, it's proven slightly more encumbersome than normal to get the crew of the ship at its current location.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As mentioned, we had losses on derivative financial instruments of $46.835 million. It's important to note that this is a non-cash mark-to-market loss on our interest rate swaps following a LIBOR decline of between 112 and 115 bps over the quarter. The total adjusted EBITDA of $72 million, including Hilli. As discussed, the decline in the group EBITDA quarter-over-quarter is due to Igloo's scheduled off-hire and increased OpEx. We expect this EBITDA trend to reverse in the next quarter as Igloo will have a full quarter of operation in Q2 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. Turning then to segment information. There are no -- sorry, on Slide 5, we have broken down our financial performance of the quarter across our 3 vessel segments, FSRU, LNG Carriers and FLNG. There are no significant unexpected deviations in any of the business segments other than the mentioned seasonality of the FSRU, Igloo's earnings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. We are reporting a cash position of $212 million, split between restricted cash of $177 million and free cash of $35 million. At the very bottom of the page, you can see that we have an adjusted net debt to annualized EBITDA of $5.2 million for the quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Again, this is expected to be improved in next quarter due to a combination of increased EBITDA with Igloo on a fourth quarter operations and reduced interest rates on the back of debt amortization through the quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Page 7. We maintained a very solid revenue backlog for the group with the Golar Grand extension for 1 year and filling the gap on Golar Maria, we had an earnings backlog still of $2 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Page 8. We have a diversified backlog. Our $2 million -- sorry, $2 billion earnings backlog is split 60% on our FSRUs, 32% on the FLNG Hilli and 8% on the LNG carriers that typically have shorter charter duration and lower rates than the other 2 segments.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Golar Partners, as you can see on the right-hand side, have been successful in obtaining the earnings backlog and obtained charter extension at the end of our firm contracts. As you can see, this remains fairly stable over the period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The recent successful redeployment of the assets demonstrate the underlying value of the existing assets that you can see by the various recent awards summarized on the text box on the bottom right.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Slide 9. This is showing the operational utilization on a per segment basis. As alluded to on the GLNG call earlier on today. The FLNG Hilli has operated on 100% economic utilization since delivery. It's just about to offload its 39th cargo, more than any other floating liquefaction vessel in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Similarly, we have shown a very stable operation for our FSRU fleet. Last quarter, it came in at 88% for economic utilization. Again, this is due to the Igloo scheduled maintenance season, and we expect that to revert to full utilization in Q2. Keep in mind that these utilization graphs exclude the two idle vessels, FSRU Spirit and the LNG carrier Mazo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For the ships, by nature it's more lumpy utilization because they do have waiting days in between charters and downtime for maintenance. But still, we are happy with the 74% utilization. And again, expect that to increase as we now fill the gap on the open available days for 2020 for the 3 operating vessels.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Slide 10. As Tor said, we contemplated to do a transaction that included a large refinancing. Due to the outbreak of the epidemic, that transaction was put on hold, and we had to approach the bondholders with an amend and extend. We successfully extended the duration of our 2 unsecured bonds, maturing in May 2020 and May 2021 by 18 months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With a net-to-EBITDA ratio of around 5x, an earnings backlog of $2 billion and a 95% distribution cut, deleveraging the balance sheet, we are confident in a successful refinancing of the upcoming bank and bond maturities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our target is to increase a bank refinancing facility, replacing the facility maturing in April next year, collateralized by the FSRUs Spirit, Freeze, Winter, Igloo, and the carriers, Methane Princess, Grand and Maria in order to lower the amount needed for bond refinancing of both the $150 million GOLP02 bond and the $250 million GOLP03 bond.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We've already engaged in discussions with the lending group behind the existing $800 million facility and expect to revert with more feedback on that in the second half of the year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to the market, on Slide 11, we have witnessed a steep drop in LNG prices through the first 5 months of 2020, with cargoes confirmed sold as low as the dollar per MMbtu. As you can see on the top left graph, LNG is now the cheapest fossil fuel in Asia. It's priced at 75% of coal on the dollar per MMbtu equivalent. This is clearly underpinning the competitive advantage that any gas-fired power plant or industrial consumer has in the current environment, switching from coal, diesel, heavy fuel oil to LNG. And that's before considering the superior environmental benefits of natural gas over coal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to the right -- top right graph. A similar situation is seen in Europe where TTF has dropped below coal in early May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A forceful metric to pay attention to is the so-called Spark-Dark spread. It's essentially the difference between generating electricity from coal compared to natural gas. The dark spread in Central Europe is today negative $25 to $30 per megawatt hour, suggesting a significant cost and environmental saving in switching from coal to gas fired power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Coincidentally, we've seen in the FSRU market, over the past 10 years, an average around 6 contract awards per year. Year-to-date, we've only seen 1. We find that slightly strange given the very clear incentives to switch to LNG, but we are also seeing some fatigue in the market due to COVID-19 to do significant changes to energy sources at the moment. So hopefully, this will increase. And we do expect it to increase with, hopefully, COVID easing up because it certainly is up here in the north.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Slide 12. The FSRU market remains highly active with more than 60 projects referenced by IHS, as proposed in addition to some 30 currently in operation and 8 under construction. There's nothing wrong with the depth of the market. And as we pointed out, the economics of LNG as a fuel source are cheaper and cleaner than the alternatives.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the chartering side, we're actively working to secure employment for the FSRU fleet through participating in tenders, working with clients on a bilateral basis to help them lift projects.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And obviously, working with existing charter counterparts for charter extension or modifications to the existing FSRU locations that we have in place. The last point I want to emphasize on the market is how FSRUs remain and will continue to be an integral part of the LNG value chain that provides flexibility and opportunity to grow the global LNG market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Financing of coal-fired power plants are increasingly difficult and FSRUs are the fastest way to access LNG for anyone looking to get access to the cheaper and cleaner LNG cost and environmental benefit fuel arbitrage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Turning to Slide 13. Whilst the principles of ESG has always been an integral part of Golar's operations, we are just embarking on reporting on our ESG performance. Golar recently launched their ESG report on their website. And Golar Partners intend to follow along the same framework in the near future. We have focused on 5 key areas that we see as vital key performance indicators: One, health, safety and security; two, environmental impacts; three, energy, efficiency and innovation; four, people and community; and five, governance and business ethics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In light of the times we're living in, ESG is more important than ever. We've spent considerable time and effort to ensure our employees are safe because safe and healthy employees are our most important asset to deliver services to the highest of standards.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Getting crew on and off vessels, organizing up-storing, maintenance, dry docking and generally operating a large suite of assets has been and still is more challenging under COVID-19 than in a normal environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Therefore, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our people onshore and offshore for the dedication they're putting in to make sure we maintain our high operating standards and economic utilization across our fleet that we touched upon earlier in the presentation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'd like to conclude on turning to Slide 14, summarizing the presentation and the quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The highlights include the charter extension for Golar Grand and filling the gap days for Golar Maria, making sure that 3 of our 4 LNG carriers are fixed -- or fully fixed for the remainder of the year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The coming 3 quarters, we expect full contribution from Golar Igloo, which will improve run rate revenue and EBITDA and also the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA multiples accordingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our revenue backlog remains at $2 billion before any extension options. We've successfully extended the maturity of both of our unsecured bonds for 18 months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The announced distribution cut will allow the partnership to delever and ease refinancing of upcoming maturities. With the net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5x, earnings backlog of $2 billion and a 95% distribution cut, deleveraging the balance sheet, we are confident in a successful refinancing of upcoming bank and bond maturities. Record low gas prices favors LNG as a cheaper and cleaner source of energy versus alternatives with new markets opening for potential FSRU contracts, seeking access to LNG fuel and environmental benefit arbitrage. And also frontier markets, as Tor Olav mentioned in potential floating data centers fueled by LNG and similar.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Golar MLP continues our strategic review of the company in order to maximize value of our asset portfolio and strong earning backlog to all of our stakeholders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That concludes GMLP's Q1 earnings presentation. I'd like to thank you all for dialing into the call. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for any questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Questions and Answers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [1]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Chappell from Evercore ISI.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Jonathan B. Chappell, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD [2]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl, I don't know if Tor Olav is still around. Karl, my 2 questions are both strategic in nature. And I know that you're relatively new, but you've been associated through the Magne Partners. So first, if we could talk about the debt maturity profile. I know the bonds are different than syndicated that. But you'd mentioned that the difficulty with the epidemic, getting refinancing for the bonds and with that big balloon payment due for next year, what gives you the confidence that you can get that refinancing done in this environment? And is there anything else that you may have to give up, whether it's ability to grow when you think about that refinancing?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [3]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, sure. So when it comes to the bonds, as both, Tor Olav and I mentioned, we were embarking on a transaction that looked to both refinance the bank facility and do a strategic transaction that we think would enhance the credit quality of the group. Our plan was, therefore, to address the bonds following such transaction. Because of COVID-19, that transaction was put on hold and the debt capital markets collapsed or at least came to a significant halt together with the banking market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The way we look at the future, even without any strategic transactions, is that we have a strong support from our existing lenders to extend the so-called $800 million facility, which will be $500 million when it comes for maturity in April next year. We do think that it's possible to increase the size of that bank facility beyond $500 million, reducing the need for a new bond -- or reducing the size of a new bond. So the plan will be, number one, address the bank financing and increase leverage somewhat; and number two, address the bonds thereafter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All of this needs to be seen in light of a strategic review of the company, but we're obviously standing both for a strategic review and for a going concern on a generic basis. And we're very confident that the banks are there to support the company on the refinancing of the $500 million. We have expressed confidence letters from the banks. And we also think it's likely that we can increase the size and therefore, enable a smaller refinancing than the maturing bonds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Jonathan B. Chappell, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD [4]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Got you. So then as my follow-up, you noted in the press release the review could include sale of assets for which you've had unsolicited offers thus far. When we think about the partnership going forward, should we think about the -- a transition right now? I mean, from the smaller capital structure potentially shrinking the fleet, should this just be focusing on -- or are you thinking about just focusing on buy the better assets with the longer duration contracts and becoming more of a bond because with the prohibitive cost of capital, maybe growth is just kind of off the table for the foreseeable future?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [5]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think you touched upon part of it by saying the prohibitive cost of capital in the company has obviously part of what's triggered a strategic review. I would say right now everything is sort of on the table and part of the discussion, and we haven't concluded one way or the other. When it comes to opportunistic vessel disposals of noncore assets that would be potentially looking to dispose of assets that not viewed as significant cash-generating pieces in the business. And for example, the 2 idle assets that could be interesting to monetize in order to raise cash to potentially reduce the size of a refinancing. But we're certainly having ambitions for the -- well, as part of the strategic review, we certainly have ambitions for the company going forward, and we don't view this as any run off scenario to put it that way.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [6]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our following question comes from the line of Randall Giveans from Jefferies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Randall Giveans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - VP,Senior Analyst &#38; Group Head of Energy Maritime Shipping [7]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So first on the distribution. Just kind of curious how you came up with that annual payment of 8 -- $0.08 I guess, how is the math behind that and why cut it 95%, right? And then secondly with the cap on the distribution, how long does that cap last? And are unit repurchases an option under these new terms? Or is it just delevering?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [8]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Okay. So the reason why the number is exactly what it is, is that it was a 95% cut. For us, it was important to maintain some dividends as we understand that, that's a requirement from certain of our unitholders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the same time, we saw that the employed yield we traded on pre the dividend cut didn't really suggest that investors fully appreciated the cash flow stream from the company. We therefore found it more -- better value to the company to cut the dividend and redeploy that capital for deleveraging, given that we have a large amount of refinancing upcoming in the first half of next year. When it comes to unit repurchases, again, this is part of the strategic review, everything is on the table, and it's part of what we're considering. But again, no conclusion has been derived thus far.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Randall Giveans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - VP,Senior Analyst &#38; Group Head of Energy Maritime Shipping [9]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Great. And then how long is that cap in place for distribution increases?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [10]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So what we've put in place now is a 95% cut. That's something that's under the existing bonds, which are extended for 18 months, if they're refinanced, there's nothing putting a cap on distributions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Randall Giveans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - VP,Senior Analyst &#38; Group Head of Energy Maritime Shipping [11]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Got it. Okay. So at least for the next 18 months the distribution that you said $0.08.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [12]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unless, they're refinanced earlier, yes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Randall Giveans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - VP,Senior Analyst &#38; Group Head of Energy Maritime Shipping [13]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. All right. And then any updates on the Golar Spirit? Do you think it will be used possibly for a Golar Power project in Brazil?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [14]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'd say, Golar Spirit has been idle for about 2 years. As highlighted in this presentation and the current gas price environment suggests that the likelihood of activating her has increased from what it had in a higher price environment. Also the attractiveness of entering into the LNG fuel arbitrage for frontier markets, including certain hubs in Brazil, could certainly be of interest. Of course, that needs to be weighed against the fact that there's been 1 FSRU award year-to-date. But we are experiencing increased interest for her. But I don't think we want to guide on anything because these are very binary in nature, all these discussions. So I don't think we want to probability weight or anything, but we have an increased interest at this point.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Randall Giveans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - VP,Senior Analyst &#38; Group Head of Energy Maritime Shipping [15]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Got it. All right. And then lastly, you mentioned there on the refinancing for 2021. Do you expect that to possibly increase some liquidity or just maybe an extension with a more aggressive amort profile?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [16]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, the way the company is set up right now, we don't have a need for any significant increased liquidity. So adding debt just to have cash sitting on the balance sheet, obviously, we want to have a comfortable balance sheet cash position. But then again, we have quite good earnings visibility, given our earnings backlog. So our focus would primarily be on reducing the average cost of debt or at least reducing the mix between bank and bonds, as we all know from an interest point of view bank that is cheaper than bond debt. And if we can change the mix more in the favor of banks, that should benefit the company over time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [17]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our following question comes from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Benjamin Joel Nolan, Stifel, Nicolaus &#38; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [18]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So my question relates again to the financing and refinancing. Obviously, there's the bonds that you've already done and the bank debt that comes due next year. But the other big part of the financial leverage is the Hilli debt or your portion of the Hilli debt. Collectively with GLNG, is there any thinking around possibly being able to refinance that or any ability to refinance that and maybe accelerate the release of the restricted cash that would enable you to maybe take out a portion of the bonds or something like that? Or is that not something that can be done now?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [19]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think on the call with me today, we also have the financial -- Financial Director of the Golar Group; Brian Tienzo, he's also the former CEO of Golar Partners. Given that the Hilli financing is dealt with sort of in the Golar Group, I think I'll hand that question over to Brian. He'll respond to that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Brian Tienzo;Golar Group;Financial Director, [20]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No problem, Karl. Just -- just to tackle the easier of the two. So on the LC, so as you know, we've been reducing the LC over the period of time. There remain some balances in there, and there is a program step down of the LC that's related to production of the Hilli. So the next step down is in May 2021 next year, where the balance steps down a bit more to $200 million. And that -- because of -- a big chunk has already been released, that will release a little bit, but not a lot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As it relates to the refinancing of the Hilli, I think we've guided previously that the extent that we have positive progress on discussions with Perenco and SNH on either the expansion or extension of the employment of the Hilli. I think that would be the best time to try and do it. I think certainly, in the current environment, it's probably not something that you would want to attempt to do. And we're very happy with the facility that we have in the corporation we have with the lenders. But to the extent that the economics of the project improves even further, then that will be the time that we would look to try and make that financing more efficient and economical.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Benjamin Joel Nolan, Stifel, Nicolaus &#38; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [21]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Okay. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, it's -- as it relates to sort of new ideas, and you mentioned the possibility of maybe floating power, which you've seen a little of or floating data centers, those are a little bit more further out. I'm curious, our discussions on that front in either of those cases. Are those really ongoing? Or is that a little bit further down the path in the near term, or we should really just be thinking about assets as FSRUs or maybe floating storage?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [22]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, there's certainly being developed, a lot of projects for floating data centers issued by LNG and so forth. And I think more and more people are catching on to the LNG fuel arbitrage, obviously, that's increasing by the day as LNG is now cheaper than even coal and obviously way more financeable and more environmental friendly. So we do see that occurring, and we do see it occurring now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the -- our assets, we will obviously continue to monitor and try to develop that situation. But we do see, given the size and capacities of at least the older assets in the fleet. We do believe frontier markets and that type of projects are the most likely for longer-term employment beyond their existing charters or existing FSRU locations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tor Olav Tr&#195;&#184;im, Golar LNG Limited - Chairman of the Board [23]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Maybe I can add on here. I think it's. Maybe I can just add on a little bit on that. I think what you have seen lately now is, for instance, the needs group, which have affected with Hilli, I think, delivered more than 10 of the floating power stations. They are now trying to convert those power stations from these [base] fuels and heavy fuel over to LNG. So that's a market which is up already. When it comes to the development of data centers, there is significant work done by the capital shipyard, which we're working with, which are now trying to deliver these kind of 100-, 200-megawatt of what data centers on a floating basis. It's out there a little bit. But I think as a feeder for both kind of power and data centers, our assets are there already. So -- and of course, we don't have any FSRU, which are off over the next 2, 3 years. So you need to think out a little bit, and that's what we're doing right now. But the market for these assets are increasing every day. It's hard to get deals done. I think it's easier now when the prices are low, when people see the benefit of it from an economical point of view as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [24]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our following question comes from the line of Sanjay Ramaswamy from Bank of America.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sanjay Ramaswamy, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst [25]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So maybe we've talked a lot about the strategic review here. But just maybe elaborating on that a little bit further. But -- so in a scenario where the parent GLNG's commitment towards MLP slowly diminishes, are you guys -- I mean, how are you guys really thinking about preparing for life on your own, like we're hearing that the continued strategic review of your company and the parent continues to go through the same process. But just remind us of the time line of that strategic review and how you guys are really preparing for all kind of scenarios here?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [26]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, sure. So the strategic review is obviously ongoing. What you are discussing is, again, part of the discussion items, given that pretty much everything is on the table at the moment. We do expect to be able to have more of a direction in terms of what we want to achieve and do with the company during the second half of 2020. We do expect a conclusion to a strategic review to be ahead or at least concurrent with the refinancing because if you are going to do strategic things, it's obviously -- there's no point refinancing if you could just about to do something straight after or straight before.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So that's how we think about it. And if there is a life -- or if we are thinking about sort of breaking loose, then there is -- we obviously need to staff up in terms of the chartering. We're relying on Golar for doing that. But I don't think neither us nor Golar, have you given any signals that, that's the direction. And again, from the Board and especially from the Independent Committee's point of view, all of these alternatives need to be taken into consideration. And the focus of the strategic review is very much to maximize the value for all stakeholders. Do you think we will look at this in terms of how we can maximize value and then we will go in that direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sanjay Ramaswamy, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst [27]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So that's really helpful. So I mean just moving on with the Hilli, would there be any kind of scenario where you'd be willing to monetize the interest there, just given the environment, given the circumstances here? Or maybe you can just talk about the potential scenarios with the Hilli?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [28]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think in the GLNG call, prior to this one, there was obviously a strategic or a discussion with both Ian and (inaudible) on the potential for both increased utilization and extension of the contract. I think there's no hiding that -- well, first of GMLP, obviously, on strain and 2 that are fully contracted through 2026. But the real value trigger, if one were to monetize these units, would be if there's an increase in utilization and, of course, duration. Duration for us in the MLP is more important than expansion, given that what we're exposed to is already fully utilized.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But for us, closely monitoring that situation and any potential extensions will be critical in terms of determining the value of the unit and we were encouraged to see the SNH article yesterday that suggests that there are conversation between Cameroon, SNH and Perenco and us for an extension of the unit. So we're monitoring that closely. Obviously, the Hilli is a very important part of our cash flow generation, and we need to, as part of the strategic review, weigh run rate EBITDA generation versus a one-off potential disposal of the unit with the restrictions the unit have in terms of charter approvals for disposals and so forth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sanjay Ramaswamy, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst [29]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Great. That's really helpful. Maybe just a last one from me. Just coming in with fresh into this -- into the strategic review, kind of what have you found as the most kind of -- glaring kind of opportunity for change here from your perspective, and in terms of over the next 6 months, what you can actually visibly or what you can actually change?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [30]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That's a very good question. I'm not sure if I want to elaborate too much in detail on this call. One thing is obviously financial structure and dealing with the near term maturities. That's a fairly obvious one in terms of both of bond pricing and, hopefully also, equity pricing. When you have such a large amount of your debt coming up for maturity next year, addressing that is a sort of easy one to see.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Obviously, anything you can do in terms of extensions, adding cash flow, adding visibility, adding value to the fleet would be helpful.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I wouldn't say that's a discovery I've made, but obviously, reactivation or disposals of idle assets is another fairly straightforward way of creating value and assets that are currently sitting still and have a very small negative carry in terms of idle OpEx.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When it comes to the specific strategic discussions, I think I'll refrain from commenting on that on this call. I think, again, as we alluded to earlier on the call, we'd like to get back to that in the second half.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [31]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our following question comes from the line of J. Mintzmyer from Value Investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; J. Mintzmyer, Value Investor's Edge - Lead Researcher [32]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So great discussion earlier on the liquidity and the financing challenges. So nothing to add there. Just look at the Spirit FSRU, really the clear asset you have that could potentially provide some value, it's been in lay-up, as you said, for 2 years. On the Golar call earlier, they mentioned, there's 3 more terminals in Brazil that are getting developed. There's 15 potential global contracts you're looking into. Has there been a specific project, either in Brazil or globally, that has been identified as a good fit, right, for the spirit, the smaller, older unit? Or is it still kind of up in the air?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [33]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I can only comment on behalf of Golar Partners, of course. But when it comes to Golar Power, there, they have been developing the terminal in Sergipe. They have won the power plant award in Barcarena, not yet taken FID on the terminal, and they have several other terminal projects, both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. It's natural that as part of their toolbox, they would consider amongst other FSRUs within both Golar LNG, Golar MLP and potentially internationally, FSRUs available to them. Given that they're in the Golar Group, they obviously have extensive knowledge to Spirit, both in terms of our specifications, what's the possible upgrades, and what would the cost of those upgrades do. Most likely, they would have a better view on that versus other potential chartering candidates. And they've proven with a very similar vessel in Golar Freeze that it's certainly possible to upgrade a vessel of this specification and this vintage and still get long-term contracts like a 15-year contract in Jamaica.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So -- the sort of showcase is there. It's part of the toolbox, and it's certainly something we, as Golar Partners, do encourage. But at the end of the day, that development on the terminal side that you're referring to is then in Golar Power. But we, as Golar Partners is obviously, actively marketing the vessel, both for Golar Power for other parties trying to do the same and also looking into whether we could actually do some of these terminal projects ourselves, taking, instead of just looking at long-term TCEs, also taking a view on potential partial utilization or even spreads where you buy LNG in at a price per dollar MMbtu, and then we charge-out another price, and then we do all the operations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So that, I guess, a general comment to that question.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; J. Mintzmyer, Value Investor's Edge - Lead Researcher [34]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. Certainly. I know it's hard to give an exact answer on that. I know New Fortress, your partner in Jamaica, already is still doing other terminals as well. So maybe there's potentially something there.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just a final -- I think that was a good segue, final question. What would the CapEx be for that sort of thing? I guess Part 1 would be just getting it out of lay-up with that cost. And then Part 2, if we looked at the Golar Freeze as sort of a mirror and you want to do the same thing with Spirit, what would the total CapEx bill be for that?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [35]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Again, good question. So obviously, if she are to be activated, she needs to go through docking. That would most likely be around $10 million. And then there's potential upgrades dependent on the charter. So for Freeze, I think the total CapEx docking and upgrades was around $15 million. And I think $5 million to $10 million is a fair estimate of incremental CapEx over and beyond the $10 million in docking costs dependent on the contract and the exact specification of the contract.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; J. Mintzmyer, Value Investor's Edge - Lead Researcher [36]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So it sounds like about $15 million to $20 million total. Excellent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [37]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, it could be slightly less if she is to be used just as an effort to you as a storage unit, but if you also want to use the Regas, yes, then that's a fair estimate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [38]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There are no further questions at this time. Please go ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [39]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thank you all for dialing in to listen to our first quarter presentation and for good questions, and we look forward to catching up. Yes, Tor, did you have any final remarks?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tor Olav Tr&#195;&#184;im, Golar LNG Limited - Chairman of the Board [40]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think I'll leave it to you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Karl Fredrik Staubo, Golar LNG Partners LP - Interim CEO [41]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (inaudible) that then, thank you all. We look forward to connecting both between the next quarter and certainly on the next quarterly call. And thank you all for your interest. Thank you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [42]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Stocks to track in trade today: ONGC, Bharti Airtel, JSPL, M&#38;M Finance</title>
            <link>https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/markets/article/stocks-to-track-in-trade-today-ongc-bharti-airtel-jspl-mm-finance/614486</link>
            <description> ONGC reports a first time ever quarterly loss while RITES reports a decline in profit. In other news Carlyle is to acquire 25 percent stake in Nxtra while JSPL is looking to sell stake in its Oman subsidiary&#60;p&#62;ONGC&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ONGC reported a first-ever quarterly loss of Rs 3,098 crore on account of impairment loss which the company accounted for due to the fall in oil &#38; gas prices. The Revenue from operations during the quarter declined 26.9 percent to Rs 21,456.2 crore on a year on year basis. The operational performance was also impacted partly due to the lower revenues. The EBITDA fell by 37 per cent to Rs 5,549 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RITES&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RITES reported a 4.3 per cent decline in its profit to Rs 144 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as against Rs 150.5 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. The revenue declined by 22.6 per cent to Rs 570.7 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 737.3 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bharti Airtel&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Carlyle is to acquire 25 percent stake in Airtels Data Centre business. The Carlyle Group will invest approximately $235 million in Nxtra Data.Carlyle values Airtel's Data Centre Business Nxtra at a valuation of $1.2 billion. Upon completion of transaction Carlyle will hold 25 percent while Airtel will continue to hold the remaining 75 percent stake.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;JSPL&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;JSPL is looking to sells stake in its Oman subsidiary to Templar Investments Limited in a deal valued at over $1 billion. The divestment is in line with JSPLs vision and commitment to bring down its debt and deleverage its balance sheet. The sale still needs to be approved by shareholders, lenders and India's markets regulator, but expect the transaction to be completed within a month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Gujarat State Petronet Ltd&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has accepted the proposal to transfer authorizations for developing City Gas Distribution (CGD) Network in the Geographical Areas of Amritsar &#38; Bhatinda District to Gujarat Gas LimitedIt permits Gujarat Gas to take over activities of laying, building, operating or expanding CGD Network from GSPL.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;GMM Pfaudler&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;GMM Pfaudler has entered into a binding term sheet with De Dietrich Process Systems India (DDPSI) for itemized sale of their manufacturing facility at Hyderabad, Telangana. A consideration of Euro 6.25 million will be paid for the proposed transaction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;M&#38;M Finance&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In an update the Company said almost 75% of its customers opted for a Moratorium on EMIs, which is impacting the Companys daily cash flow and liquidity. Also, the new business in April and May 2020 was substantially lower than the previous years volumes. They expect an increase in digitally enabled lending and collections even in rural and semi-urban markets. They envisage a pick up in demand and financing for Pre-Owned Vehicles and Agri Machinery (Tractors).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2020/jul/01/telangana-amends-frbm-act-extends-borrowing-limit-2163629.html</link>
            <description> According to sources in the Finance Department, the gross borrowing was Rs 34,000 crore in 2020-21 Budget.&#60;p&#62;HYDERABAD: Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Tuesday promulgated The Telangana Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thus, the State government accepted the recent decision of the Central government to expand the borrowing limit of the States under FRBM Act from the present three per cent to five per cent, allowing the States to borrow more to face the present financial crisis arisen due to COVID-19 pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the States are eligible to go in for market borrowing up to five per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), only after fulfilling the conditions laid down by the Centre. The State may fulfil all the conditions, except reforms in the power sector. Even if the reforms in the power sector are not implemented, the State can raise a loan up to 4.5 per cent of GSDP this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to sources in the Finance Department, the gross borrowing was Rs 34,000 crore in 2020-21 Budget. The net borrowing was Rs 30,000 crore at three per cent of around Rs 10 lakh crore GSDP. Thus, the State can raise extra loan up to Rs 20,000 crore in this fiscal under FRBM Act at 5 per cent of the GSDP.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If the power sector reforms are not fulfilled, then the State can raise Rs 15,000 crore taking the total net borrowing of the State to Rs 45,000 crore. The States market borrowing are Rs 12,461.2 crore in the first quarter of 2020-21. Meanwhile, the State government accorded administrative sanction for Rs 2,587.9 crore for Kaleshwaram Irrigation Project, so that the bills can be directly claimed in order to expedite the process of interest during construction (IDC) payable to banks in time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> India's consumption of coal fell 3.3 per cent to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said&#60;p&#62;CHENNAI : India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's consumption of coal fell 3.3 per cent to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency Moody's Indian unit ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9 per cent between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7 per cent this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>India reports first quarterly current account surplus in 13 years</title>
            <link>https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/india-reports-first-quarterly-current-account-surplus-in-13-years/story/408533.html</link>
            <description> The current account recorded a surplus of $600 million or 0.1% of Indian gross domestic product in the three months to March 2020 compared to a deficit of 0.7% in the same period a year ago, RBI data showed&#60;p&#62; India's current account turned positive in the last quarter of the 2019/20 fiscal year as a result of a lower trade deficit and a sharp rise in net invisible receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said on Tuesday, the first quarterly surplus in 13 years. The current account recorded a surplus of $600 million or 0.1% of Indian gross domestic product in the three months to March 2020 compared to a deficit of 0.7% in the same period a year ago, RBI data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This represents the first time that India's quarterly current account, which measures the difference between the value of a country's imported and exported goods and services, has recorded a surplus since the January-March quarter of 2007. The RBI data also showed the current account deficit ( CAD ) for the October-December quarter of 2019/20 was revised to $2.6 billion or 0.4% of GDP from $1.4 billion earlier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "On paper this looks healthy but it primarily reflects India's economic slowdown, which has significantly reduced the non oil, non precious metals imports during FY20 ," Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&#38;T Financial Holdings, said. For the year as a whole the CAD narrowed to 0.9% of GDP versus 2.1% in 2018/19, the data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Net services receipts increased on the back of a rise in net earnings from computer, travel and financial services," the RBI said in a release. "Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, increased to $20.6 billion, up by 9.0% from their level a year ago," it added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly to $35 billion from $35.2 billion a year ago, RBI said. Balance of payments stood at a surplus of $18.8 billion in Q4 of 2019/20, compared with a surplus of $14.2 billion a year ago, the RBI data showed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There was an accretion of $59.5 billion to foreign exchange reserves in 2019/20, the RBI said. Forex reserves recently climbed to a record $507.6 billion before falling slightly. "Our forecast for a modest deficit could easily swing to a surplus if differential of global versus domestic economic activity widens, lending to slower recovery in core imports," Radhika Rao , an economist with DBS Bank said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>How Darwinbox's Evol&#62;e' is helping organizations enable a safe return to work'</title>
            <link>https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-technology/how-darwinboxs-evole-is-helping-organizations-enable-a-safe-return-to-work-26174</link>
            <description> The company announced a specially curated HR Technology suite (Evolve) with deep-tech and mobile-first features like touchfree attendance, vulnerability&#60;p&#62;analytics, virtual ID cards etc. to help organizations plan a safe return to work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The above quote cannot be truer than the times we are living today. From the sudden imposition of a complete lockdown to the need for safe opening of offices despite the continued threat of virus, companies are forced to evolve at lightning speed as the situation unfolds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Darwinbox, a cloud-based Human Capital Management platform has launched a specially curated HRTech suite for Asian enterprises, Evolve, to help combat the rapidly changing people's priorities in the new world of work'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Darwinbox Evolve is designed to meet every organization's pressing concerns from employee safety to remote work productivity, engagement, and compliance to new regulations through a single seamless solution.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Chaitanya Peddi, Co-founder of Darwinbox shares, As the new normal dictates new ways of working, there is a need for systems that not only automate processes but provides digitally advanced ways to engage a remote workforce and ensure a safe return to work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First Reactions: How organizations adapted instantly with the digital-first HR Technology&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have always had a drive for innovation at Darwinbox, which had led us to offer several future-ready solutions like facial recognition based attendance, digital rewards, continuous feedback, mobile-based check-ins, much before the current crisis. Leading organizations such as L&#38;T Metro, Rivigo, Kotak Life Insurance, Adani Wilmar have been early adopters of these features. However, with the current crisis they were no longer good-to-have tech but must-haves that directly impacted business continuity and productivity said Chaitanya Peddi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Darwinbox has firmly held on to the belief that disruptions call for the need to innovate like no other. The hire-to-retire HR technology platform has been enhanced with contextual features at an unprecedented pace to support the customer needs well in time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Some of these features include Virtual ID cards (dynamically generated QR code with shift data) that is used by a leading media house, HT Media to restrict employee entry to office based on their shift (allowed entry only in office shift) and track attendance in a touch-free manner. This enabled HT Media to ensure optimal workforce at office while rostering them on staggered shifts between office and home. Also, the majority of Darwinbox's Customers tracking attendance through biometric shifted to touch-free mobile-based attendance with geotagging and facial recognition. ( Read how L&#38;T metro replaced biometric with facial recognition-based attendance much before the pandemic&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Daily work check-ins' feature was another enhancement that aided many of them including a leading Life Insurance firm in India with 7000+ employees spread across 100+ branches. Organizations were able to track an employee's daily planned and completed work and gauge productivity levels by making this information readily available to managers and relevant stakeholders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Another example is where one of the top 10 Pharmacos in Asia leveraged Darwinbox's digital HR letters capability to help employees self-generate their exemption passes that could be shown to local governing authorities while heading to work during the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Employee safety, remote work, touch-less operation, and a need to be connected with everyone without hampering the experience became the immediate focus for organizations. The right technology to manage the crisis that comes with the pandemic was the need of the hour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Introducing Darwinbox Evolve - WorkTech for the New Normal'&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In an interaction with many organizations recently, we understood that several companies were not equipped with return-to-work or remote-work capabilities in their existing HRMS and were facing several practical limitations in switching to a full-fledged HRMS in such short notice. Given this reality, we set out to provide a specially curated solution like Evolve - a collection of only must-have features that help organizations navigate this crisis and set themselves up digitally for success quickly, shares Chaitanya.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Agile, Flexible &#38; Optimized on Investment&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Given the current urgency that organizations are facing, the solution is extremely quick to implement and helps organizations go-live within just a few days and is flexible to operate independently or co-exist with any other system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the current context, where everyone is forced to be frugal, Evolve helps organizations avoid the need to deploy an entire platform and rather invest only in features critical to their operations at the moment. Any organization not using the Darwinbox HRMS suite can also benefit from these modules specifically tailored to tide over these current times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Digital-first Solutions Offered for Return to Work' &#38; Remote Work'&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The technology platform, Evolve, which works for businesses of every shape and size comes with select features shared below to support organizations with 3 key priorities:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Prioritize Employee Safety:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Touch-free attendance with geolocation and facial recognition technology helps employees mark attendance directly from their smartphones and avoid physical contact with biometric devices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Vulnerability Analytics helps organizations avoid calling employees at risk to the office by analyzing data points like age, past health data, travel history, family members age, zone of residence (red, orange, green) etc.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Staggered Shift Scheduling allows companies to rotate employees between the office and home shifts for the week ensuring only optimal % of employees work from office.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Visitor Management helps organizations mandate appropriate approval flows for external visitors &#38; use QR code-based authentication to allow entry of visitors in office premises.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Remote Productivity &#38; Engagement&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Remote Work Check-Ins drive productivity by empowering employees to report planned and completed work for the day which is accessible by relevant stakeholders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Helpdesk helps resolve employee queries pertaining to COVID or remote work on priority through SLA tracking and dedicated team allocation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Continuous Feedback &#38; Rewards and Recognition, a mobile-first and gamified way to help employees stay motivated &#38; guided in remote mode.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Digital Onboarding with e-documents and multi-role custom workflows ensure new talent is hired and enabled to be productive right from day 1, even in remote mode.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Organizational Social Network connects employees virtually to engage in pan-organizational conversations as well as to stay updated on Org announcements through e-noticeboard.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Adapt to New Ways of Governance and Compliance&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Virtual ID cards are dynamically generated QR code-based ID cards that display shift location (home/office) which can be scanned to mark attendance as well as to restrict entry of employees into premises only during their office shift.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Daily Health Surveys helps record symptoms and calculate risk score for employees on a daily basis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; HR Letters &#38; Documents helps organizations auto-generate letters or mandate digital sign-off from employees on any new policy updates issued.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Audit-Ready Reports provide the ability to report workforce % at office on any day or trace back employees who worked together in shifts for audit or investigation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All Evolve' features are already available to Darwinbox's HRMS suite customer base of 350+ Asian enterprises including brands like A dani Wilmar, Max Bupa Life Insurance, L&#38;T Metro, Kotak Life Insurance, Arvind group, Dr. Reddys, Paytm, Swiggy, Bigbasket, Nivea, Bisleri , etc. Over 900,000+ employees have adapted to the new normal' at work with Darwinbox's remote-friendly and engaging technology that promotes safety in the new workplace.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; To know more about the product or to get a demo visit - Darwinbox Evolve&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Coal minister appeals to CIL unions to withdraw strike call, says no plans to divest PSU</title>

            <description> One being asked about plans with regard to separating CMPDIL from CIL, the minister said, "Factually it is not correct and we are supporting CMPDI&#60;p&#62;New Delhi : Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday made an appeal to CIL trade unions not to go on strike and said there were no plans to either divest the PSU or hive off CMPDIL, Coal India arm, from the maharatna firm.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The trade unions have given a call for a three-day nationwide strike from Thursday against the government's move to open the coal sector to private players and separate the state-run firm's exploration, planning and design arm CMPDIL from the company, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"I appeal to the coal workers not to go on strike. This is not needed. We are already working (on a solution)," Joshi said, in a telephonic interview to, when asked about the strike call given by unions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;One being asked about plans with regard to separating CMPDIL from CIL, the minister said, "Factually it is not correct and we are supporting CMPDIL. I want to make it clear that there is no move to either divest Coal India or withdraw CMPDIL from Coal India."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government, he said, wants to assure all the coal unions that there is no need to worry and the Centre is fully with CIL and coal workers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The coal ministry is in constant dialogue with the trade unions, Joshi emphasised and expressed confidence that the government would be able to convince them to withdraw the proposed strike.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Yes yes. Even today our secretary (coal) had a detailed discussions with them. There apprehension is not correct... We are trying to strenthgen (Coal India), we are providing so much to them. Why should there be apprehensions," the minister asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CIL is the PSU looking after the chunk of the coal requirement of the country, so it will be strengthened and promoted, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Coal India is our strategic company. Power sector is the strategic sector and to supply adequate power to the country Coal India is strategic again," he explained.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"In 2023-24 we want it (Coal India) be made one billion tonnes..., so Coal India is going to continue as dominant player," Joshi stressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coal India, he said, produces a little over 600 million tonnes (MT) while the country's requirement is around 900 MT, resulting in a shortage of around 300 MT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Whether we should produce our own coal, being the fifth or fourth largest reserves (of coal), or we should import from countries like China, Australia, Indonesia and burn it here. Burning of coal will be for next 30 years but whether we should burn our coal or we should burn the imported coal, this is decision we have to take at this point of time," he explained. Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Palestine rejects Israeli annexation plan: Abbas... July 01, 2020 India's 17% coal fleet set to become uncompetitive: Researchers Economy, Business, National,, July 01, 2020, 08:28 am Daily World&#60;p&#62;New Delhi, June 30: In India, 17 per cent of the 283 GW coal fleet is set to become uncompetitive in 2020, rising to 50 per cent in 2022 and 85 per cent in 2025, international researchers said on Tuesday. They say phasing-out and replacing uncompetitive coal plants with renewable energy plus storage would generate savings of $2 billion in 2020, $8 billion in 2022, and $17 billion in 2025. Researchers of Rocky Mountain Institute, Carbon Tracker Initiative and Sierra Club in a report offer financial data and specific tools for making global coal phase-out feasible. The report, 'How to Retire Early: Making Accelerated Coal Phase-Out Feasible and Just', reveals that new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate coal plants in much of the world. It lays out specific financial strategies that utilities and policy-makers can use to engineer a faster phase-out of coal in various regions of the world. This new analysis shows that new renewable energy is not only cheaper than new coal plants virtually everywhere, but that it is already cheaper to build new renewable energy capacity, including battery storage, than to continue operating 39 per cent of the world's existing coal capacity. The share of uncompetitive coal plants worldwide will increase rapidly to 60 per cent in 2022 and to 73 per cent in 2025. Replacing the entire global coal fleet with clean energy can be done at a net savings to society as early as 2022. "A faster transition from coal to clean energy is within our grasp and we show how to engineer that transition in ways that will save money for electricity customers around the world, while aiding a just transition for workers and communities," Rocky Mountain Institute, Managing Director, Paul Bodnar said in a statement to IANS. The authors estimate that replacing the entire fleet of global coal plants with clean energy plus battery storage could be done at a net annual savings as early as 2022. The rapidly declining costs of renewables push net annual savings to $105 billion in 2025. All this, the report states, is before considering coal's dire health, climate, and environmental impacts, or accounting for the social and environmental benefits of reducing pollutants. Currently, coal phase-out hasn't kept pace with eroding economics. To keep the Paris Agreement's temperature targets within reach, global coal use must decline by 80 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030, requiring rapid transition in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the next decade and phase-out in the rest of the world by 2040. India has already set aggressive targets for renewable energy development, aiming to increase clean energy output from 86 GW in 2019 to 175 GW by 2022, and 450 GW by 2030. Although India expects continued growth in energy demand, the government has identified almost 23 GW of obsolete coal plants to be considered for retirement by 2022, and an additional 25.6 GW to be considered for retirement by 2027. Aside from meeting growing demand, coal also employs hundreds of thousands of people in India, both directly and indirectly. Therefore, just transition for affected workers will be of particular importance. Today, 17 per cent of the Indian coal fleet is uncompetitive compared with renewables with storage, and the immediate phase-out and replacement of this portion of the fleet could bring India $2 billion in annual savings, says the report. The remaining 83 per cent could be phased out and replaced at a cost of $23 billion immediately. However, these numbers are rapidly changing: by 2022, 50 per cent of the Indian coal fleet will be uncompetitive, and 85 per cent by 2025. In 2025, savings from retiring uncompetitive plants will increase nearly nine-fold compared with 2020, to $17 billion per year. The remaining 15 per cent would cost $2 billion to replace in 2025. /IANS&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Chinese apps ban: All apps must hold fast to India's data integrity, says Niti Aayog CEO</title>

            <description> The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country&#60;p&#62; Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Tuesday said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy and sovereignty, a day after the government banned 59 apps. Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data. The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency. They must be transparent in origin &#38; final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Indians will leverage strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design. He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators," he said. The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual control in Ladakh&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures," the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Peeved at govt apathy, locals decide to merge with Bangladesh</title>
            <link>http://theshillongtimes.com/2020/07/01/peeved-at-govt-apathy-locals-decide-to-merge-with-bangladesh/</link>
            <description> SHILLONG: Livid at the lackadaisical attitude of the state and central governments to solve the border connectivity issues, residents of four villages in Indo-Bangla border of Jaintia Hills have unanimously decided to give their villages to Bangladesh if the government is not willing to start road connectivity.&#60;p&#62; In a statement issued here, spokesperson of the four villages, Kynjaimon Amse, said public meetings were held in the villages to discuss course of action given the fact that the government has not been serious enough to build the road for them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stating that people have been frustrated and tired, he said, Through the meeting, it has been unanimously decided that the village dorbar and its more than 5000 population will give the four villages and its 5000 plus population to Bangladesh if the government is not willing to construct the road for us.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He went on to add that the people have also decided that the four villages will write to the Government of Bangladesh to request for construction of the road since the state and central governments have failed to render any solution to their problems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Prima facie, it is clear that the lives of the border population do not matter at all to the government and we are being used just for votes. If the government really considers us as Indians and is serious about our problems, then it should immediately address the road problem and interim measures should be taken up to ease the issues failing which the people will have no choice but to take extreme steps, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Pointing to the deplorable condition of the Rymbai-Bataw-Borkhat-Sonapur Road, Amse said the condition of the road has affected the livelihoods of over 5000 people who live in Hingaria, Huroi, Lahalein and Lejri villages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With the absence of a proper connectivity, proper medical facilities, lives of the people have been crippled.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stating that the government is least interested in these border villages, he said people have to rely on neighbouring Bangladesh for their survival.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The world may be facing lockdown for the first time )but the people of the above-stated border villages have been under lockdown since their existence as they are cut off without road and communication and no one knows what is going on these villages, Amse said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He added that there have been instances where patients have lost their lives because of not being able to reach hospitals on time, adding that some people even resort to crossing the border seeking medical attention.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The farmers in the villages are the worst sufferers as they have to shed huge amount of money just for transporting the products to the nearest market and sometimes due to the bad condition of the road they have to sell their products at a very nominal rate to Bangladeshi traders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stating that almost all the problems of the people in the villages are linked with the bad condition of the road, he said unless the road problem is solved there can be no development and growth in these villages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Amse recalled that the villages had written to the chief minister, governor, PMO, Home Ministry, NITI Aayog, Finance Ministry, NEC and many other offices of the Union government, seeking intervention. Even after the matter was taken up by the High Court of Meghalaya and NHRC, the governments at both levels have been reluctant to the needs of the people, Amse said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Asserting that the proposal worth Rs. 123 crore for construction of the road has been lying with the DoNER Ministry since April 2019, he said that the Ministry has not even discussed the proposal till date.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Daily Tech Briefing: China Responds To India's App Ban, Swiggy Launches Wallet &#38; More</title>
            <link>https://inc42.com/buzz/daily-tech-briefing-china-responds-to-indias-app-ban-swiggy-launches-wallet-more/</link>
            <description> China said that it was concerned about India's decision to ban Chinese mobile apps Indians will leverage the strength of diversity and build for India together, NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant said&#60;p&#62; Swiggy has tied up with ICICI Bank for the Swiggy Money wallet service&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Soon after the government banned 59 Chinese apps, the country shifted its base to several TikTok replacements enabling players like Chingari, Roposo and Instagram to get new sign-ups and higher traction. On an official level, China said that it was concerned abou t India's decision to ban Chinese mobile apps such as TikTok and WeChat and was making checks to verify the situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; China is strongly concerned, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. In response to this, Chinese have been questioning that even if Chinese people want to boycott Indian products, they can't really find many Indian goods. Indian friends, you need to have some things that are more important than nationalism, tweeted Hu Xijin of Global Times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In response, Anand Mahindra said that this comment might well be the most effective and motivating rallying cry that India Inc. has ever received.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy and sovereignty. Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a series of tweets , he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world. Indians will leverage the strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) has criticised the government's move to ban 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, ShareIT, UC Browser, Helo and WeChat among others, to safeguard Indian users' data privacy. IFF added that the concerns listed by the government, those of data security and citizen's privacy, as reasons for the ban were legitimate. However, safeguarding those concerns can be ensured through regulatory processes which emerge from objective and evidence-based measures. This ensures credible action that protects individual liberty, innovation &#38; security interests.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Amid this, among the beneficiaries of the ban are the Indian alternative to TikTok, Chingari, Roposo etc. The Bengaluru-based company, which developed Chingari last year, has been noticing over 100K downloads and over 2 Mn views per hour since the China-based app was banned. With TikTok going offline at 6PM on Tuesday, Chingari's viewership almost doubled to 370K users per minute from the 187K users prior to that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Zomato Gold Turns Pro; Swiggy Adds Wallet&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Online food delivery platform Zomato has revamped its controversial premium services Zomato Gold to incorporate 50% more dine out and delivery restaurants. The new platform has been named Zomato Pro and will incorporate all existing Zomato Gold users.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The foodtech unicorn has announced the customers will be offered extra perks under the Pro subscription. This will include faster deliveries, exclusive delivery offers and money-back guarantee. The company also believes that Zomato Pro will pull the levers to drive growth in the struggling restaurant industry and help them cover up the losses they incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Further, the foodtech giant is also said to be looking to raise funding from Singapore-based VC Temasek. The deal was almost finalised but the terms of the deals are being renegotiated due to the impact Covid-19 had on Zomato's business. With most restaurants closed, Zomato had to service the limited number of orders through cloud kitchens, while it also expanded its grocery business.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Temasek started investing in Zomato in 2015. So far, it has infused close to $41 Mn (INR 310 Cr) and holds a 3% stake in the Gurugram-based food delivery business. Its latest investment in Zomato is a part of the larger $500 Mn round.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bengaluru-based food aggregator unicorn Swiggy has launched its own digital wallet Swiggy Money in partnership with ICICI Bank to enable a single-click checkout experience' on its platform. The full-fledged digital wallet will allow customers to store money and pay for all food orders on Swiggy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Swiggy Money is powered by ICICI Bank's insta wallet service' which is built on a cloud platform with API integration. It enables Swiggy to create a digital wallet instantly for its customers. If the Swiggy customer happens to be an existing ICICI Bank customer, they can instantly start using the wallet, the company said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Further, taking lessons from ecommerce companies, ride-hailing aggregator Ola said it has rolled out an in-app tipping feature globally to allow users to pay an additional amount to driver-partners to express gratitude while helping driver-partners increase their earnings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The feature has been rolled out to all Ola users across India, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and will benefit Ola's over 2.5 Mn-global driver community.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Microsoft-Accenture To Accelerate B2B Startups&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Microsoft on Tuesday announced to collaborate with global professional services company Accenture to host the third edition of the Accenture Ventures Challenge for B2B startups in India. This edition will recognise startups in India in four categories: supply chain resilience, channel shift to digital commerce, systems resilience and responsible technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Accenture Ventures Challenge 2020 will identify 12 innovative startups that are helping to address the business and human impact of COVID-19. The winner in each category will be given an opportunity to join the Accenture Ventures Open Innovation partner programme and co-create solutions for Accenture clients around the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Uber Eyes Postmates, Reddit Cracks Down On Trump Community&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Uber is in talks to buy Postmates seeking to expand food delivery services in the US and capitalize on a surge in orders, during the coronavirus pandemic. The report added that Postmates is alternatively exploring various paths to go public. One option it is considering would involve merging with a special purpose acquisition company, the report added. In the talks with Uber, a deal could value Postmates at $2.6 Bn, according to the Wall Street Journal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Social media site Reddit shut down r/The_Donald, the Community which long served as the home base for fans of US President Donald Trump, saying it violated the site's hate speech rules. Other sites also conducted high-profile sweeps: Amazon's live-streaming platform Twitch temporarily banned Trump's official channel, saying it violated Twitch's policy on hateful speech, while Google's YouTube suspended six leading white nationalist accounts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> (ANI) A day after the Centre banned 59 mobile apps with China links, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that any apps released in the country must adhere to Indias data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency and stressed that the country has to stay data sovereign.&#60;p&#62;All Apps released in India must adhere to Indias data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency. They must be transparent in origin and final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action is taken are lifestyle apps, Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amid the ongoing border tensions with China in Eastern Ladakh, the Centre had on Monday banned 59 mobile apps including Tik Tok, UC Browser and other Chinese apps prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity and defence of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A senior official at the IT Ministry said the prime reason to block the apps under section 69 A of Information Technology Act is to stop the violation and threat to the security of the state and public order and to plug the data leaks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Almost all of them have some preferential Chinese interest. Few are from countries like Singapore. However, the majority have parent companies which are Chinese, the official said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure the safety and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace, Ministry of Information Technology said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Index trend and stocks in action on July 01, 2020</title>

            <description> Nifty began the session on a firm note, however, it failed to capitalise on it and in the second half of the trade, it succumbed to selling pressure and at once, breached 10,300 mark but some recovery in dying movements helped Nifty to claw back above 10,300 mark and end the day with modest losses.&#60;p&#62;On the daily chart, Nifty formed a bearish candle after two successive days of the Doji formation. In the last four trading sessions, Nifty is seeing a narrow range of 10,194.50-10,409.85. During this range-bound trading, the majority of the candle formation is indecisive in nature. Besides, it clearly indicates that a tussle is seen between the bulls and bears. Bulls are not letting the price drop, while bears are not letting it move higher.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Usually, this type of tight consolidation leads to sharper moves. Earlier, similar consolidation was seen between May 18-May 26 and after breaking out of the range, the index marched nearly 14 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Trend traders would be hoping this consolidation to take some decisive direction by breaking out of this range. As trading in such a narrow range is providing enough opportunities to trade. Hence, on the higher side, keep a watch on 10,410 mark and on the downside break, watch out 10,194 levels. Break on either side would open doors for a directional move.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A sustainable move above 10,410 would open doors for 200 points and similarly, a move below 10,194 would result in a swift move of 200 points.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bharti Airtel: Carlyle to acquire approximately 25 per cent stake in Airtels Data Centre business at a valuation of US$ 1.2 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Affle India: The subsidiary of the company on June 30, 2020, completed the necessary closing conditions for the acquisition of 66.67 per cent shares of Appnext Pte Ltd and our step down subsidiary has completed the necessary closing conditions for the acquisition of 100 per cent Tech assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Marico: The company has acquired the balance equity stake of 55 per cent in Zed Lifestyle Private Limited from its existing shareholders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hero Motocorp: Building on its focussed strategy of creating a robust portfolio of premium products, Hero MotoCorp, the worlds largest manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters, has commenced the dispatches of its eagerly-awaited new motorcycle-Hero Xtreme 160R.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jindal Steel and Power: The company is set to sell stake in its Oman subsidiary, Jindal Shadeed with a deal size of over US$1 billion to enable the companys debt reduction plans.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>COVID-19 Is Boosting Demand for Universal Healthcare  but Wont Get Us There</title>
            <link>https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-india-universal-health-care-universalism/</link>
            <description> With the COVID-19 exposing the fragility of Indias healthcare system and the profiteering nature of corporate hospitals, there has been some optimistic expectation of substantial change in the healthcare scenario of the country post-pandemic. However, the cynic knows that there rarely is a trickle-up of activist sentiments and intellectual rationale into the &#195;&#169;lite corridors of power.&#60;p&#62;In fact Indias administration has its priorities sorted. The NITI Aayog is going ahead with its plans to create more private medical care centres by privatising district hospitals. Ayushman Bharat authorities seem to think its a good idea to allow the World Bank  the ideas of which have weakened government healthcare facilities in many countries  to influence their analyses. And major personalities in the government seem to be living in a parallel universe cleaved from reality. The refusal to acknowledge community transmission of COVID-19, the hydroxychloroquine debacle, led by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the downplaying of the migrants crisis are just some examples.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With such indifference, arrogance and denial going around, we cant expect the administration to be argumentatively convinced to implement progressive reform after the epidemic ends. That leaves us with influential citizens who often exert some influence on government policies. Have they at least woken up to the need for healthcare reform? Most privileged Indians indeed are furious with corporate hospitals. However, it seems much of this anger springs from the individually-oriented peeve that healthcare was made too pricey for them than the universally oriented principle that everyone deserves quality and affordable care.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In fact, the principle of everyone receiving adequate medical care irrespective of their ability to pay for it (as expressed in the 1946 Bhore Committee report) has hardly animated political and &#195;&#169;lite discourses beyond the early years of independence.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But that doesnt mean that people in India did not, as is often lamented, prioritise healthcare. They actually have always lobbied for good, affordable healthcare services  but only for themselves: i.e., as a group-based demand and not as a universalist demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consider the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). When it was proposed in the early 1950s for central government employees based in Delhi, the goal was gradually to scale it up to other cities and, over subsequent years, to most of the population. What happened is that the CGHS did expand to other regions  but was kept exclusive to government employees. Most of Indias elite officers climbed the ladder of this generous healthcare scheme, but on reaching the top they kick it away instead of sharing it with others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Though there was organised lobbying for medical services in the early decades of independence, it rarely was universalist: central government employees, Employment State Insurance Scheme members, railway employees and defence personnel all lobbied for better healthcare services for themselves and their families, and sought to restrict outsiders from accessing their facilities. Privileged Indians who did not belong to any of these groups used private nursing homes and private wards of government and charitable hospitals as their domains, and the super-privileged oftentimes just flew abroad. Later, in the 2000s, the rise of private multi-specialty hospitals and employment insurance made even the occasional middle-class visit to the government hospital a rarity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In short, over time, all privileged groups in India have managed to carve out more-or-less comfortable medical care niches for themselves depending on their paying capacities. And as they kicked the ladders away, they also looked the other way. For decades, the privileged have known but quietly ignored the disrespectful, at times abusive, nature of care provided to the underprivileged, as well as the fact that many of them slip into lifelong poverty due to healthcare expenses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is thus perhaps too optimistic to expect that the pandemic will effect a radical change in such entrenched attitudes. An indifferent political class and an inward-looking, injustice-inured privileged class together point to a status-quoist post-epidemic future for India when it comes to healthcare reform.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Healthcare reform here is universal healthcare (UHC), which in Amartya Sens words is an affordable dream. For India, this means major improvements in preventive and primary healthcare, and in the quality and quantity of care in government facilities, eventually halting the over-reliance of Indias millions on private facilities that are invariably driven by what activists call profits-over-people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Unfortunately, the much-publicised Ayushman Bharat scheme hasnt helped with respect to UHC. Insurance-based schemes are at best a temporary, stopgap measure, and at worst an expensive distraction from installing more equitable and sustainable structures of UHC. The underprivileged are not unwilling to pay for healthcare and preventive measures like nutrition, but our existing system makes them pay far more, sometimes catastrophically more, than they can afford. It is this asymmetry that UHC seeks to remedy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now, as we demand healthcare reform in a post-epidemic India, we must remember that the powerful and the &#195;&#169;lite are not suddenly going to be convinced of the towering idea that the underprivileged deserve the same kind of quality healthcare services and protection from financial stress as they enjoy. Public health experts have conducted lots of research and written several volumes on the urgent need for UHC, but the translation of research findings and expert recommendations into common sense is a political act, and cant be accomplished by academicians. UHC also needs the skills of many others like social scientists, activists, journalists and grassroots advocates working on the ground with communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mobilising and organising communities around specific goals is not exactly a skill that is taught in public health courses, but it is an important part of public health policy. Since academic alone cant achieve that, they need to reach out to others who can; an excellent example of such multidisciplinary, community-based advocacy in India is the work of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. Making eloquent arguments through scholarly papers and tweets is one of several steps required for the people and politicians to take academic work seriously.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Recent student-led agitations and women-led movements against discriminatory government policies have shown that a substantial number of ordinary Indians are receptive to progressive, universalist ideas and are willing to push politicians to work towards them. But public health goals will lose out on this willingness if the public at large is not mobilised to demand these goals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Considering COVID-19 wont be the last pandemic our generation encounters, and that serious climate-change-induced healthcare challenges are already knocking on our doors, the absence of UHC in a country of 1.3 billion means we are constantly on the cusp disaster. India cant afford to neglect putting in place, as quickly as possible, a robust UHC apparatus. And public health experts, on their part, cant afford to ignore putting in place strong alliances with community-based, politically active individuals and groups. Post-epidemic India needs UHC to stop being just a top-down expert recommendation and turn into a bottom-up grassroots demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Kiran Kumbhar is currently studying the history of science at Harvard University, focusing on the history of medicine in modern India. He is also a physician and a health policy graduate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

So when we looked at the ambiguities, we had to show the market in less than 90 days everything, and at the same time, start an investigation to discuss the leak of false information to the market, and at the same time, hiring an accounting forensic consulting services.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On top of the findings we would get using our own experience to find information through internal sources, we were able then to show the authorities and the marketplace the new financial information and first quarter data. So due to the time it took and the difficulties of this unusual situation caused by the pandemic, in a nutshell, considering all these difficulties, I would like to say that we are able to pull it off. In 90 days, we're able to show the results we showed, be them about the investigation that took place and all the other financial reports throughout the year. So we were able to what SUSEP did.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So putting all this in context, we would like to first apologize. I would like to state that this current administration will be defined by being absolutely obsessed with transparency, taking into account the history of the company and taking into account every single investors, individuals, strategic investors, companies...&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [2]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ladies and gentlemen, please hold.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (technical difficulty)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [3]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I don't know where we were cut off. But anyway, I was talking about credibility. We all believe that credibility is a crown jewel as diamond, something that's extremely precious. If credibility is indeed that diamond, from those who believe for -- from the perspective of those who trust someone, we have to take into account that credibility is crystal, is delicate because of what happened in early February, all the way up to the beginning of March.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [4]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ladies and gentlemen, please hold.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (technical difficulty)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [5]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I was talking about credibility, right? Credibility is like a diamond. At certain points in time, it becomes delicate as crystal. We have to take good care of that diamond as if it were as fragile as crystal. We have to be transparent, clear, true. And that is, in essence, the way we should treat this very important asset. In other words, we have to get the pieces of that crystal together so that we can bind together these broken pieces, paying close attention to our KPIs. And the share price is the output as a consequence of the work we do with our customers, our business partners, according to the law being very clear, transparent and professional, which is key to the insurance and reinsurance businesses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Having said all of that, let me just talk about principles and let me talk about the findings. And I would like to summarize that in a sentence, there's no right way to do the wrong thing. Let me repeat that. There is no right way to do the wrong thing. You waste time, and it's wrong. And we cannot condone with what's wrong, period. As I was saying before, everything is related to doing the right thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And secondly, one of our basic principles is we shouldn't rush, but nonetheless, unrelenting effort in these 90 days. We worked round the clock and at the same time, not rushing to conclusions because that would send the message to our stakeholders that we were jumping to conclusions and providing solutions that were not substantial, truthful and valuable to the corporation. In that framework, let me just say to all of you that from the commercial point of view and the activities we conduct with our customers, and I can even mention data from beyond the third -- the first quarter. And despite all these ambiguities, things that we could not announce to the market, the result is very satisfactory given the circumstances. We did not detect any major issue in our competitiveness. We remain competitive despite all these difficulties. We managed to renew to all. All contracts that would expire by the end of the month, major contracts are on track, both in terms of monthly payments. And we are in agreement with all partners that enabled this major achievement for this period. We truly believe that the work we're doing has good quality, and we should do so in providing that good service to our customers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ever since we took over, we took office, we instituted these principles. We should have the best standard in the industry and offering solutions and to preserve that competitive advantage the company has in markets where it operates, especially in Brazil in terms of speed and quality of our underwriting. And we should clearly understand that this is a market full of opportunities. And that's not the focus of many of our competitors, and that's a market that can be explored consistently through the means of proportional contracts, supporting small and midsized partners so that they can enter new market niches. And by providing our technical capabilities, our robustness, our size will enable them just like we were doing ever since -- or since late last year. We can continue to be a differentiated player by resorting to strategic channels.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, having said that, both in terms of adapting the regulatory framework of the company and including the mid-term and long-term strategies for the company, this is our focus so we can have a clear understanding for the second half of the year. But we already have defined what the pillars are for that strategy. They are dependent upon our capacity to take those competitive advantages of the company and bring them to the front line, and at the same time, understanding the regulatory framework of this circumstances, and at the same time, attack the structural problems of the company so that the company can develop itself with sustainability, with no peaks and valleys, taking into account the volatility that is inherent to this business. And this is what we have been doing since mid-April to issue the company's debt equity. And given the current market scenario, there is excessive liquidity. These prices can be very costly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the same time, we try to find statue -- or stature principles. These bylaws were approved in the past April 23 to give the company some authorized capital. We're now considering the possibility to leverage the company to meet these 2 pillars. This was announced yesterday to address the regulatory issues and to have the necessary conditions to take the company forward with security, with confidence. And when we take -- when we talk about taking the company into the future, it's to have a clear understanding of the regional footprint to reconsider the business portfolio of the company we have today. And when we look at those items in the portfolio where the results are not as expected, we can start a reunderwriting process so that the company can have results where they are. That's our core business. We are a very streamlined company. We look for operational efficiency. This is what we have been seeing in -- recently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When I joined the company, I had no idea of how digitally prepared the company was. And when we move out of this pandemic, we have a new context. This is what we call working from home, and that's what we -- I call it smart or smartly working from home. And we can have a new configuration in place because we are digitally prepared. That gives us flexibility so that we can make changes in the workplace, a workplace that is more appropriate, better balanced to give our employees better working conditions. So taking into account customers, strategic business partners and also taking our employees into account, we can take good -- we can benefit from these competitive advantages and also create value. We can say that our number one goal is transparency; number two, is to provide good quality services; and our third priority is to create value to the company that can be translated to our investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'll turn the floor over to our IR running the show from now on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [6]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'm going to start with the slides. So the figures, the numbers are now on Page 2, where I'll be addressing the main highlights. This new -- the start of the new management, we started in the second half of March, you know that. We were going to have a strict (inaudible) crisis. And the idea was to recover the company's (inaudible) company, well-known in the Brazilian market. And on behalf (inaudible) we started to renew the company. The Board had the standard of [incorporation] under a format of (inaudible) We already have 7 independent members, all of them very experienced in their respective (inaudible) And they'll help us go through this period and help us (inaudible) in terms of governance, reinsurance, (inaudible) matters which will be held by the Board from now on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We can now have a much better prepared governance. We started that investigation to understand how that kind of confidential information was announced to the market, and incorrect information, of course. We detected other issues that deserve our attention. We had material fact issued on Friday, and the Board actually authorized it. And because of those findings of that investigation, just like Cassio pointed out, we hired a forensic consulting firm, and we came to the conclusion that we had to again show our financial results that were important, imperfections that had to be corrected and brought to the public. That's what we did. And at the same time, just like Cassio said, we had to fight the pandemic. So we found ways to protect employees, and at the same time, we supported remote services to our customers. That's something that is very dear to us. We had a special cabinet put in place to deal with the pandemic. And of course, there are some threats out there. And we had to put together a strategic plan to look for opportunities. So despite that housework that we're doing, so we also did not lose sight of the opportunities, getting in touch with our major customers and working together with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let me again talk about the COVID issues later or shortly. And we had the SUSEP investigation team, and our CRO will be talking about that issue later in the presentation. That material fact that was announced, we put together a plan in place.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let me show you on Slide 3. These are the changes we have in our Board. We have a new structure in place. During that assembly, we received authorization to change the size of the executive board. Governance is now in the hands of a few people. And we expanded the executive team so that we could segregate these activities so that we can be in accordance with international standards. Just like I said, the Board has been strengthened by bringing in reinforcements, if I may. We had a new Board member that will be announced shortly. That once again is in line with that intention to share information to have someone to bridge the gap between the company and the market, people from underwriting, technical people from the claims department. And we did not have that kind of exposure. And now as that statutory position, they'll play that role.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On to Slide 4, I will be talking about COVID-19. There are if different impacts depending on the industry. Pandemics is an excluded risk in our contracts. There's a bill being discussed to include that risk. Unemployment rates are on the rise, so we have fewer people employed, you can reduce premiums. But something that can go back to normal levels when things go back to normal, so there is a significantly smaller possibility of accidents. Many -- or fewer people out in the streets. In terms of property, there's a decrease in asset values. It's only natural. So the trend was that of a rise in prices up until the pandemics. So asset values are directly impacted, and again, infrastructure, major engineering projects have been postponed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There are impacts in our future results for this segment. Price adjustments in the property segment as the prices are going down, but renewal fees are on the rise at about 20%. That shows a change in that industry. There's a positive impact. The rural segment will have a bumper crop, about 245 million tons, a 4 million ton increase. It's a very important industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Oil and gas now. Of course, the impact is dramatic. Oil prices are down. We were expecting that segment to grow dramatically in Brazil up until the pandemics, of course, and that uptake in the business will be postponed. There are fewer investments in the area. Others include aviation and financial risks. There's a major impact in passenger traffic and financial risks with smaller investments and the need of less guarantees.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Worldwide, the reinsurance industry has been suffering dramatically with exposure. There are 3 major risks: the one that deals with capitalization, travel and events, and those that are willing to take the risk of the pandemic. We are not operating in these 3 areas strategically. It does not affect us where reinsurance business is being affected.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Wilson Toneto, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Member of Executive Board and Executive VP of Risk &#38; Compliance [7]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to be talking about specific inspection done by the SUSEP. Before starting, just to make it clear that, that special inspection does not bring or does not mean any kind of interference. It is a more robust inspection, counting with additional resources on the regulatory part so that they can follow up on this transition that the company is going through right now. It was started because of the lack of assets to guarantee our technical provisions because of regulatory liquidity requirements on the part of the regulating agency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When we analyze the main causes, we can break it down in 3 different factors. Number one, an increase in technical provisions, which were realized because of this review of the adjustment of our financial statements. When we revisited those financial statements, the new estimates emerged and the technical provision issue emerged. So we needed to adjust to address that issue. Another important matter was that there were certain assets that were bringing those technical provisions down or were being offered to cover those technical provisions, which were not adequate, were not proper. So we also tackled that particular point. And lastly was the effect, the foreign exchange effect, which is quite important.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The regulatory liquidity issue, which was verified in this quarter, has been addressed by the company in a very active manner. We are going after mid and long-term solutions and also short-run solutions to be able to face that situation in a proper manner. We have work groups which are very much engaged in that process. Now we have conducted some divestments act. We are realizing assets, which are not enough to cover our technical reserves. And we are also working on raising third party resources, be it to reduce debt or to increase fundraising efforts. As it was mentioned before, we understand and we strongly believe that by September, we will be able to throw all those actions and measures. We will be able to address that situation very efficiently and resume some kind of normalcy vis-&#195;&#160;-vis regulatory requirements. It's important to note that no time, we had no effects on the company's operating efficiency and on our payment flow. The information we received yesterday from the Board of Directors in terms of hiring of banks to support us and restructuring our debt, and that's very important for us for this new phase, for this readjustment we're going to go through. In March, the lack of regulatory liquidity that is announced in our quarterly report is at around BRL 4.1 million. in December, it sat at BRL 1.4 million. And we haven't touched -- we have touched that issues, those issues throughout the presentation. You can check the explanatory notes as well in our quarterly report. It's all there.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Despite this provisional situation, the company remains quite solvent even after the recently announced adjustments, which are mentioned in one of the explanatory notes. We have the necessary equity, if I may. We are quite solid at 1.8x the amount required, BRL 1.2 billion. In other words, the company remains solid, robust and with a very significant capacity to correct or adjust this momentary liquidity issue.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So I now give the floor over to (inaudible) for his part of the presentation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unidentified Company Representative, [8]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Okay. Now on slide -- the next slide, I'll be talking about the main highlights. Net income, BRL 1.763 billion as it was mentioned, a negative impact of around BRL 550 million without the adjusted income. Adjusted to all the impacts mentioned before, it's down to BRL 1.2 billion. The main drivers for those impacts are also described in our financial statements, which were announced. And we can see there that the main items are claims, which grew significantly and were not accounted for. And written concessions of claims in that period, also explained in detail in our explanatory notes and in our quarterly report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just as an aside, in terms of performance analysis, we continue our work to improve this material. The company's numbers do include more numbers, more explanations, more details. Our focus is to become obsessed with transparency to be able to provide the best of information to you, gentlemen.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So on top of claims, we also had the real estate front of our financial statements. We have 2 fronts, as you know, and also the allocation of undue payments, which we've identified in the period. So that's an important snapshot of our net income and its respective impact. And I'm going to try to address all those questions. On top of that, of course, taxes that needed to be recalculated because of the lower level of income that we realized.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Now moving on to Page #7, if you will. We have -- it's the same topic, but from a different point of view now from the point of view of SUSEP, the regulatory agency. And then we can see a bit more information and the respective impacts, which are the same that we experienced. But to the benefit of time, to explore in the Q&#38;A session, more efficient, I'll just skip this slide because it says pretty much the same what the previous one did.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Slide #8, we see capital gains as it relates to shopping malls, a clear picture of what happened in terms of revenues, costs and capital gains, which we achieved. And that's broken down on property by property, reaching a final number of BRL 387 million in the year, which contributed to this year's profit income. And this is not the company's core, of course. I was just emphasizing this, highlighting this just for you to have a clear picture of our results in 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Slide 9, moving on to dividends and interest on equity as contemplated by the companies that have to put together a reserve for profit. But due to that insufficiently, that lack of regulatory liquidity, as mentioned before, after the deposit, as a bylaws, we allocated BRL 1 million to support business also as contemplating our bylaws. Just to reinforce, we need to address the regulatory solvency requirements. And also, we need to preserve and increase the company's operating capacity so that we can continue to move on in our path to offer our services and so on. And we also need to support investment and expenses, investments in technology, other important projects, acquisitions if the time is right. And so all of that needs to be taken into account when we do those calculations, when we try to figure out dividend payout to our shareholders, what kind of resources would make up that reserve as I put in our last shareholders meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Now we can move on to page where we have -- 11, we have the results for 2020. We are closing 2019 but not yet 2020. So the first half of the total volume in premiums or written premiums increased 13.2% vis-&#195;&#160;-vis the first quarter of last year, reaching BRL 1.9 million. And the main business lines,are there listed, especially property accounting for 30% of that number, followed by life and agro. So the numbers are little on this slide, but the numbers are there. And you can see the growth, especially under property, significant growth, reached BRL 1.5 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Moving on to Page 12, you can see our written premiums in Brazil and the breakdown. So for written premiums in Brazil, we had BRL 880 million in the first quarter, which represents a drop when compared to last year, a drop of 8%, driven mainly by a lower amount of premiums issued in the period, especially in other sectors, oil and gas and agro. For property, the main reason was that we had a drop of 27% in Brazil, which was driven mainly by the anticipated renewals of premiums issued last December. And IRB continues to invest in innovation to increase the issuance of payments in this segment, which is quite important to us. As Cassio also mentioned in his remarks, that's one of the most relevant fronts for the company and should remain so in the future. In case of special risk, we saw a sharper drop, as you can see, when compared to last year, because of, again, anticipated renewal of oil and gas contracts. And in the case of agro, we saw an increase, a sharp increase actually, 65%, due to the growth of the agri business sector, which grew by approximately 10% in the quarter. Agro business as a whole in Brazil saw a growth of [67%].&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As for written premiums, abroad reached BRL 1.1 billion here on the right-hand side of the slide on the first quarter, a growth of something close to 40% when compared to the first half last year. And the main contribution, in this case, coming from the positive foreign exchange effect in the period. When you look at the premiums in BRLs, we see that sharp growth and also due to an increase in renewals of contracts in the first quarter. So we continue to have our business up and running. And that, of course, reflects in these numbers and an increase in stake in the property front, especially in the U.S. and in Europe. And because of the foreign exchange rate, we see a relative growth, which moved from 45% in the first quarter of last year to something close to 56% in the first quarter of 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Now moving on to the next slide, Slide #13. We have the main aspects concerning claims in the first quarter, BRL 1.1 million, a growth of something close to 20% vis-&#195;&#160;-vis the first quarter of '19 as readjusted. And even though we had an increase of 20% in claims, claims index saw a drop of 55% when compared to the same quarter of last year. From 77 -- (inaudible) 67% , the main variation in the quarter in terms of property, sharp increase in retained claims in that segment. An increase in the quarter, a review of claims, which was conducted, an increase in the estimate related to unfavorable court decision.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also noteworthy in the first quarter, we repositioned the company as to this view of being more diligent and more of a long-run company to be always on time making payments, adopting best market practices in terms of the claim process as a whole. The idea at end of the day is to provide a better service to clients, to have a more satisfied client.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Now moving on to the life segment, an increase of 43.3%, which refers to the accounts which were due or overdue in that segment where we had a very high level of clients.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Special risks, we saw a worsening overall because of an increase in claims coming from the oil and gas front. In terms of underwriting, we saw a growth close to 74%. The numbers improved from BRL 27 million to BRL 47 million. And the underwriting result was affected by the claims figures, as I just mentioned. And as I said, both -- as I said, we are being more diligent and also more conservative if I may, as we are preparing to go through this period of uncertainty because of the coronavirus situation. So we need to be more conservative. So we're increasing the reserve for those kinds of claims, COVID-related claims, especially under the life segment. It's a smaller contribution, as I said, but we're getting ready for it anyway.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As Cassio mentioned, the pandemic risks are in our radar. And preemptively, we made some provisions for possible regulatory requirements, again, getting ready for what may come ahead. So in light of the current scenario, underwriting went up something close to 74%, as we said, in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of last year. And Cassio, you might have something to say.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [9]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, it's important to emphasize the following. Provided the behavior we should display as an insurance company in terms of technical approaches, of having higher technical reserves and so on. Despite the fact that we saw in this quarter an abnormal behavior of certain claims, we were more cautious in terms of addressing them in the right way. And despite all this dynamic which affected our portfolio throughout this period. As it was mentioned, we had several moves of anticipation of payment or the renewal of contracts. With all of that, we saw a significant improvement, despite all of that, an improvement of 74% for underwriting. As I said early on, one of our competitive advantages in the moment where we need to get the company ready for the new situation to take this company to a safe place. We can do it as an insurance company would do. In other words, even though we're trying to find a safe place for our boat, if you will, the boat needs to be at sea, not docked at the port. So we are docking the ship at the port, but we are also sure that our business, our objective, our mission, our (inaudible) is to be out at sea, managing of course, the volatility of the waves, if I may, and getting ready -- and be ready not to be surprised by the storm.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So moving on to the presentation. We are getting place to the end.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Slide 15 now, we have a breakdown of our financial results. In the first quarter, BRL 121 million, as you can see. That's both for the financial and real estate fronts. There's a negative on the one side and a positive number on the right. The other one, as for the real estate front, as I mentioned early on, for 2019 when I talked about capital gains, the selling of all those shopping mall properties. We see the number here. That's what I mean when I say real estate result, sale of shopping mall properties in the first quarter. So one offsets the other, and then again they have a positive number. As for the financial front, the main impact was the foreign exchange issue as I had mentioned before.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lastly, on Slide #16, we have the company's net income for the quarter, net income of BRL 14 million. We compare it to the first quarter of last year where net income sat at BRL 178 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With that, we have covered what we have to share with you in terms of numbers and figures, and we can now move to the Q&#38;A. Thank you, everyone, for participating.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Questions and Answers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [1]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Salomao from Citibank.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Felipe Gaspar Salomao, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Analyst [2]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I have 2 questions actually. Number one refers to the company's profitability and return on net equity. In 2018, we saw a level of 30%. In 2019, it was close to 30% but if you remove the divesting of assets, we're going to be close to 20% in 2019. So we saw a drop from 2018 to 2019, and my question is the profitability of premiums issued? (inaudible) are affecting that. And what would be a sustainable level in terms of net income moving forward?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And also a second point concerning the caveat by the auditors for the first quarter 2020. They said in writing that the reach of the review is significantly less or falls short of that which by a proper audit process. So we have not had access to all meaningful, important fact documents that would be reviewed in a proper audit to the auditors. That's a margin there, if I may, so I'd like to hear from you, what does that message mean? What fell short? What was missing to make the auditors fully satisfied?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [3]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Felipe, this is Werner. I'll invert the order because your second question is very important. That caveat on the auditors, that's a standard sentence to that kind of review. Usually, that review goes through a different screening process than yearly reviews. Quarterly reviews are different than yearly reviews, and that's why we have that. As a rule, there is a limitation for those expert opinions as they refer to only the quarter, not a year. If you look at different quarters in the past, you'll see in the market as a whole in the industry, that's a standard way of expressing that. That's not anything out of the ordinary. It's not company-specific. That's a standard practice for quarterly reviews or quarterly audits. That's the first thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Number two, as for the profitability issue you raised, after that adjustment we made, it dropped from 30% in 2019. And then we had an impact in 2019, we had an important impact coming from claims in the agro area that affected the company's results significantly. So when you exclude those points, and we used them considerably, the return on investment for the whole operation will have a high impact when you have such an important entry for the company, which is agro with such a high level of claims, historically high. So that has also significantly affected the company's result.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is not what we expect for the next cycle as you know. We have expectations of a better growth for the next cycle of growth. But as you know, those issues might happen in years where we have El Ni&#195;&#177;o and the agri business suffers more than in other cycles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just to hedge our performance a little bit, we have started the practice of providing more information for you. We're going to try and be more transparent as we move forward to the next quarters. Even for this quarter, we want to have a more robust version, more robust than the common practice in terms of communication, the numbers presentations, so that you, you are all experienced analysts, but also our other public and who's also interested in our shares. And I mean individuals who buy our shares, not only companies and analysts like yourselves. So we want to be clear and robust in terms of communications to all those constituencies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Felipe Gaspar Salomao, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Analyst [4]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just a follow-up, if I may. What can we expect for that level? 20%, 30%?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [5]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, Felipe. As you said, we have removed the market guidance. We are not reintroducing that guidance. We have just reported our earnings. Adjusting to the standard, we have just reissued, redisclosed our numbers. This is a very -- we're at the very beginning of the new management. We're going to address and analyze the guidance. The COVID situation also leads us to be more cautious. Other companies have removed their guidance as well. We intend in the future to discuss that and bring new estimates for the future, of course. And we're going to be basing that on operating indicators and also on market indicators. So this should be the focus in terms of estimates as we resume work in this market. But for now, we won't break that number down or even disclose guidance numbers now going forward, okay?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [6]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our next question comes from Bank of America.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unidentified Analyst, [7]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; My question is a bit strategic. You adjusted for fraud, accounting adjustments. But what kind of change are you going to be conducting as far as the business goes? I would imagine that you'd be willing to run fewer risks now going forward, so if you could explore that a little bit under 2 points. How do you expect the business to evolve since you had a negative underwriting margin last year? And I know this is a segment that you see as a profitable one, and you need to, of course, grow on that front. And then how can we think about retrocession? Does it make sense to ramp your risks in the future? How do you see that? And how do you see -- how do you expect to see that line going forward?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [8]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thank you for the question. Let me start by answering your question. We are in the business of taking risks. Having said that, we'll keep on doing so. Our basic principle, which is the principle of any business, especially those in the reinsurance business, so we have to take good-quality risks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When we say we are going to re-underwrite our portfolio, what does that mean? We are looking at that part of the portfolio that is not producing reasonable results to the company. And we'll try to improve such contracts, adapt them maybe. And in extreme cases, we're not here to take on businesses that will not bring good results for the company. So it's up to us as managers to strive to have good-quality underwriting assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; There is more or less volatility. We should look at the past 3 months, maybe a 2-year or a 3-year time frame, there are new contracts that we have to keep on analyzing. So our goal is to, as managers, is to try to be as profitable as possible so that we can provide that professional management service as we are supposed to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [9]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; [Joanna], let me just try to answer the question, too. Let me just say that during the pandemic, we should look at the portfolio as a whole, and we are repositioning the global traders. So the entire world had to adapt to the pandemic scenario. We've been discussing all these issues. We have a strengthened governance structure in place, bringing in reinforcements. We're trying to better understand how to grow in the future and what are the risks involved. Other global reinsurers are focusing elsewhere. That provides opportunities here, but we have to be very careful in analyzing these opportunities. We have to take into account sustainability issues based on the industry's indicators. We have to have operational margins in the long run, so that we can allocate capital that can yield appropriate returns. That's our focus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let me just address another issue you raised whether we should take any measures to address the regulatory problems. We started conducting a study that we are planning to implement alternative strategies to restructure our capital. We have been in touch with investment banks, and we also believe that will help us. We will then first address the regulatory issues, and at the same time, helping us growing -- helping us to grow with quality as of 2020 as soon as things go back to normal later down the year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unidentified Analyst, [10]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. Let me just make sure I understood. You were addressing the regulatory issues as a priority, and contracts will be annualized individually to make sure they make sense. And you are going to grow internationally as you were going to do so. Is that correct?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [11]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let me address the first part of your question. A new administration that takes office has to look at the portfolio. In the past 30 years of my professional career when I was very young, I've been working in turnarounds and start-ups. And that's our intention, to detect what's adding value and what's not. It does not mean that the company will grow or will not grow. What it means is we want to grow profitably to keep on adding value to shareholders. The major difference and major challenge at the same time is to generate value through our core business, not through runoffs. That's key.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Once we are done with the investigations, once we turn that page, we should look at the future. First, we have to bring that ship to a safe harbor. That's what we're doing now. We're assessing the portfolio. And then -- and only then how we are going to set sail again, so that we can start our journey.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have to look at the geographic footprint of the company. Once again, is it worth to keep on underwriting in China, India or Canada? If the answer is affirmative, fine, let's expand. If the answer is negative, how can we do things differently to make that business better? If there's no proper answer because of volumes or volatility, again, we should focus, especially where the value is. And it's up to senior management and as an individual myself, where should I put my solvency elements given to me by shareholders, by organization; where can I extract more value, knowing that it's a competitive market, taking into account our competitive advantages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are a low-cost company when we compare IRB with its peers. We may very well be one of the best companies in that segment. You're going to go up 0.5 point or go down 0.5 point. I'm more concerned about how much value that team can generate from that existing portfolio and then the portfolio that is available in the market. And we're going to compete with the competitors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In crises like this, every agent, every player falls back to their key markets. That's where they'll protect their cash cows. The Swiss will focus on their key markets, the Germans likewise, the Chinese. And as Brazilians, we shouldn't reinvent the wheel. Our business view is we are going to take care of our backyard, so to speak, Latin America. And whatever is beyond that backyard, maybe a lake or a nice river, these are the more volatile markets with way more competition. So again at this point in time, we should be aware that we are sailing that ship I referred to a while ago. We should do what is supposed -- what we're supposed to do, using that technical expertise we have in underwriting, and this is just out of the ordinary.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We had a decrease on premiums on a year-by-year basis. We are leaders in several contracts and #1 reinsurer, just like Cassio said. The market is readjusting itself. Past indicators may change, will probably change. And we do not have any benchmark or any reference. But premiums may go down in Brazil, just like Cassio said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It does not necessarily translate into risks to our portfolio. We should consider exchange rate risks, and these new conditions may not be as beneficial as we expected or -- It's only natural that it would stabilize our portfolio whenever there is -- whenever there is opportunity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [12]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ms. Mariana Taddeo from UBS has the next question.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mariana Taddeo, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Analyst [13]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the first quarter for the local market, there was an 8% drop. You said that you updated renewals. How much would that growth be if those renewals took place now? In Q1, there were no impacts with insurers because of the credibility crisis of the previous management team. And finally, given the renewals you were referring to, what's the expected premium increase for the year?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [14]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I did not quite understand the question. Can you repeat the other part of the question?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mariana Taddeo, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Analyst [15]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First, how much would that growth be in the local markets if those renewals had taken place in Q1, not late last year? Commercial relations with insurers, was there any impact whatsoever there? And renewals that took place after the COVID-19 effects, what's the expected premium increase?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [16]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'll address the second question. Werner will address the first and the third one. As to the business relations with insurers, has to do with how we acted in when we have the first crisis. And the second issue was the special investigations because our stakeholders had to understand what was going on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let me address the commercial relationship, the Berkshire issue, or customers and trade partners, there was no impact whatsoever. Because that was a problem connected or about one stakeholder and one regulator. Now when I talk about the second issue, once you have a special investigation, and the management understanding how the situation was to come to the forefront and be transparent and explain 4 things:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Number one, the company's solvency. This is an absolutely solvent company. By showing that, there should be some fear as an insurer. I, of course, should be speaking the same language. Solvency is one of the best in the world. It's our solvency rate is 190%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Number two, short-term liquidity. What's that? 48 months, up to 48 months. Now up to 36 months. This is short term for an insurer, short-term liquidity. There are no problems whatsoever to maintain our payments and pay out claims, business partners to honor our payroll. How do we behave in such a situation? That's completely business as usual.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And there's more. We have noticed there were payment issues. We had to give some room, some freedom to our business partners.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First, solvencies, no issue, that's a nonissue at all. Two, Operational liquidity, no issue. And the third issue was the hedging for the budget or our balance sheet for every liability we have in U.S. dollars and one for the asset. So our balance sheet is hedged.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And number four, we have the regulatory problem. Yes, we do. And for regulators, I would be doing the same thing, if it's a 40% market share company, a company that has that track record with all the problems we have in late February and March and then it's not according to the statute. Despite the fact the solvency is protected, again, we should be -- as a regulatory agent, it's only natural that they do that. It was clear when we explained to all stakeholders because we're speaking the same language, after all. And then that has been confirmed by what we do on a daily basis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Again, our operational indicators are all on the rise. The relationship with our business partners are okay, and we're connected to our top partners on a personal level, and all our business partners both in Brazil and abroad. So there was some tension involved before we explained it. Once we explained it, there are no questions at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And Werner, and the coronavirus impacts for the growth projection?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [17]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mariana, let me talk about the anticipated. We cannot normalize the premium. Once again, let me address the good performance results. We do that on Page 12. We break that down by industry, and we're going to improve -- we're going to break that down even further to be more -- to be easier to understand that. And it's important to convey the message to the marketplace.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What's clear to us is those indices that have problems with the premium. When we talk about revenue, the impact is much smaller. In absolute volumes, it's down 27%. And special risks, especially oil and gas, it's down by 62%. This should go back to normal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As I said when you compare the primes (sic) [premiums] would affect our revenues on a monthly basis. We had that effect in Brazil, but that wouldn't give us long-term impacts. What held in written premiums for both Brazil and abroad? That was given the FX effect. We had a lot of pressure on the dollar value, and that give us a 5% impact. This is the market share, the international market share. This was due to the exchange rate. We expect that Brazil will contribute further and Latin America will follow suit because we do have the competitive advantage in that segment in that area. And I think it's important to say that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And the second question is about future premium increases for the year and beyond for the 2020 and beyond. We do not have any guidance for growth, and we are not going to announce what's expected growth. But we do believe we're growing because we'll be focusing on Brazil even further. We're going to work in that direction, but we cannot announce any numbers, any projections. We'll do so as soon as we have more information about it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [18]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario Pierry from Bank of America has the next question.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario Lucio Pierry, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [19]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (technical difficulty)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In fact, the real has devalued even further. Looking at your data from SUSEP, there was an accumulated loss of over BRL 100 million. Then we see a gain of BRL 14 million in the quarter. That means in March, the company profited BRL 125 million. That's the math I'm doing. Was there any nonrecurring effect in March? And what can you tell us about the performance of the company from March on? We're almost in July now. So for May -- April, May and June, anything you can tell us.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [20]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I'll address the first 2 questions about the results and the comparison between figures. But the very end of the question you asked was not possible to understand. So just to be clear, if you could please repeat the questions. The sound was kind of choppy, and I lost some of what you said. So if you could please repeat, especially the last question you made.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario Lucio Pierry, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [21]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No problems, Werner. The first is about the regulatory liquidity. The level seems to have changed as reported in March. And taking into account the fact that the BRL, the Brazilian real devalued significantly, was there any other significant change in that value if we update the number for today's numbers, foreign exchange?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And number two, about the data from SUSEP, for January and February, we see that the company had a loss of BRL 112 million. That means that in March, you had a gain of BRL 125 million based on the numbers. My question is was there any nonrecurring event in March? And also, if you could update us on numbers for April, May? We are on the verge of July. If you could update us on the numbers to date. Those are the questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [22]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Thank you, Mario. I only last the -- April-May bit of the question. The rest, I got.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As for the liquidity level, BRL 2.7 billion and BRL 2.1 billion as you highlighted in the quarter, we did have an appreciation of the U.S. dollar, that band. And now with the number was a lot lower than what we saw last year, November, December, BRL 0.20 compared to a growth of from BRL 4 to BRL 5.20, BRL 1.20 for the dollar in appreciation. So the effect of that appreciation a significantly lower from March onwards when compared to what we have now. Of course, that does have an impact, but it has been factored in.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And we're trying to raise capital and find instruments to improve and strengthen the company's capital structure. And we are, of course, looking ahead and we are not counting only on that tool. We have other alternatives under appreciation, which has asked to bring more guarantees in terms of assets to make sure we have enough to cover. That's the first topic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The second issue you mentioned concerning the numbers we reported in January and February compared to the result of the quarter, we have some effects. One of the effects that's mentioned during the presentation was the sale of our shopping mall properties. I was talking about the [Partheon], specifically, that property, that happened in 2020. And that represented an important market gain for the company, something close to BRL 10 million, and that positively affected the numbers for the first quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But we also had in the same period, to reposition, as I mentioned, the company and a natural resource for the moment where the company's provisions vis-&#195;&#160;-vis the COVID situation and so on and so forth. We did mention the provisions we have in place. Even though we didn't have a pandemic clause or provision, we repositioned the company to face potential impacts in the period. But we did have an important effect in terms of capital gains, as I mentioned, the sale of property.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As for April and May, we won't disclose those numbers. We have no guidance. But maybe Cassio would like to add.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [23]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It's important for us to emphasize the number on March 31. As I said early on, we are committed to transparency and committed to the truth. When we re-announced the numbers just now, last year's numbers revisited, readjusted, what was the view we had relative to the market, relative to the regulating agency, relative to ourselves? The idea was to show in a very clear manner all the findings we raised, we achieved through forensics auditing that we had around our financial numbers. It was a very deep dive in those numbers. And we concluded that the main adjustment were to be addressed at the claims entry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And when we look at 2019 and do that in 2019, we automatically accounted for the company. And there is a mere effect of that on technical provisions for the company that became what should have been the technical provisions. In that respect, we are quite comfortable that we did the right thing. And we are managing the company, as I said early on in my opening remarks, towards addressing regulatory issues in a very proactive manner within market conditions and now abiding to statutory conditions, which were delegated by the general shareholders meeting which took place on the 23rd, so that we could make a final decision in terms of going after a solution that might -- that is powerful, forceful and enough to solve that regulatory issue. At the same time, we follow on with our projects and working with free assets and potential assets that can potentially be offered rather.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So well, thank you for the question, first of all, because that gives us the chance to make that clear.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [24]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario, just one more thing. You mentioned the SUSEP numbers. When we presented our new numbers just now, we also visited -- or revisited previous months that have impact on the current months, correlated event. So this will happen for all the months that we will be reloading, if I may, when we talk about SUSEP-related data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario Lucio Pierry, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [25]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Okay. In the press release, you mentioned that the sale of the property in Brasilia took place on February 20, the shopping mall. So I thought that gain would have been reflected in February for SUSEP's sake, just to be sure. So that variation we saw, BRL 111 million in February, January to a gain of BRL 14 million, I'd like to have more color on that. The company is generating BRL 120 million per month. Is that a level we could expect to see going forward? Or is there any nonrecurring event once again?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And number two, you talked about the lack of liquidity. Do you think that could lead to a change in dividend payout policy going forward?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [26]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario, thank you. Just to be clear, the shopping mall properties, let's address that. You are correct. That's why I mentioned the reloading of the FID. This was -- this happened in February, you are correct. So it was brought to the right -- the accrual month. So it's February, so that generated an impact in 2019. That's why you do not see it. And it's SUSEP's data. Just to be clear, it was an accrual basis issue, right?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario, just to be sure, do you have a second question?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario Lucio Pierry, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [27]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. Yes. The second question has to be with the dividend payout policy. What can we expect in terms of dividend payout policy going forward?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [28]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes. The company's dividend payout, just to bring things into perspective, we are going through a moment where we're trying to take the company to a different higher level. We have issued a material fact about that. We need to be expedited. We expect, as I said during the presentation, to have this up and running by September. So the payout that we intend to have in this first period is obviously impacted, right? To be able to regroup the company, we need to address and study the adequate level of payout for the future. And as soon as we have a number -- we do not have a guidance, but when we have an idea, that's when we'll bring that to market. But right now, our main concern in terms of funding is to -- in the short run, to be very cautious in terms of payout.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Again, if we look ahead going forward in the long run, naturally, we'll have a new configuration, as I said, have a long-term view of a reinsurer. We'll have a robustness, which is important for the industry. But we'll say what kind of payout level will be the more adequate, and we'll communicate that to the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Operator [29]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our next question comes from Mr. [Ot&#195;&#161;vio Nelli] (sic) [Ot&#195;&#161;vio Tanganelli] from Cr&#195;&#169;dit Suisse.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ot&#195;&#161;vio Tanganelli, Cr&#195;&#169;dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst [30]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When we look at the claims triangle, we see that 72% level. Can we consider that a normal level for claims level?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And the second question is looking at the tax statement for 2019, we saw an activation of 76 million for the London tax credit. I'd like to understand the recurrence of that. As I see it, it was supposed to last for 10 years, a decade, but it was not clear for how long that will last.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Werner Romera S&#195;&#188;ffert, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Executive VP of Finance &#38; IR and Member of Executive Board [31]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Well, I'll address the claim triangle or claims triangle issue. And then I'll move the floor to Cassio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So as for the claims issue, as you said, we reached an average of 72%. We -- it's difficult to look forward or to have a forward-looking number for that. We're being very cautious around that number. As we've said, our job is to go after growth with margins. In other words, to find contracts with good margins and a claims level that makes sense for the company, of course. But it's difficult to forecast a new level of claims going forward. So we are keeping a close eye on it. We'll communicate with you. We'll give you all the information we have in hand by segment with the highest level of transparency possible. And in fact, we're going to enforce that. So that's important for us to be clear and transparent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But unfortunately right now, it's difficult to forecast a new claims level, not at this point. Of course, we are repositioning our portfolio, and that might have an impact going forward. And we also have a new moment, a post-pandemic moment. So it's difficult to make any forecast at this point, just to make it clear.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ant&#195;&#180;nio C&#195;&#161;ssio dos Santos, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Interim President, Member of Executive Board &#38; Director [32]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For claims, we have exogenous and endogenous reasons or factors, as Werner said. What will happen with the world after the COVID-19 situation? What will happen in this new world order? What kind of economic effects will we have. As insurance and reinsurance, our activities which are a function of GDP, of course, whatever impact on the national income will reflect immediately on insurance and reinsurance companies. So the exogenous factor, we have no control over. We might try to estimate, but nobody will take that chance now to make a forecast, unless or except for large international survey companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But as for the endogenous factors, the ones that depend on us, we've covered before here, right? It is only a day's work. It is part of our industry. And we'll look at our portfolio. If we need to do a re-underwriting, we'll do it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In other words, when we talk about an assessment of the portfolio, we're talking about -- from 2 different fronts. What kind of appetite the company has a risk and in what and where, in which geographies? And number two, what kind of quality am I willing to take for risk for each of the portfolios? And how can I improve that? And how can I adjust that vis-&#195;&#160;-vis the risk level? And expecting if that risk is not generating any value and an impact in solvency, I'll do something else if it's pressuring our margins or our technical reserves and provisions. In short, that's a very complex analysis with one single objective, which is value generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And claims. Within all that, claims might work as a tool to solve. But we always look it from the value generation standpoint. Look at claims, and we'll do that looking at the different segments where we work. To talk about an average claims level is still generic. We need to look at -- from business line from business line standpoint. Some business lines have more recurrence. Others have fewer recurrences. So we need to look at it in a very close-up way. And the trade-off will come in terms of volatility. So looking at the claims in this as an average trend at a certain moment could lead to the conclusion. In fact, we'll be managing a company one way -- well, the way you expected, other words with ups and downs, high volatility. So to avoid that, the assessment of the portfolio and the balance of the portfolio, balance including risks or higher risks or lower risks, will be very important in that assessment. And that will provide us with more reassurance, more comfort in terms of high risk, high volatility business.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I just remembered something very important. We are very anxious to know about the new regulatory framework which is being put together by the Brazilian government, by the regulatory agency, which might present -- as far as I know, might bring some relief in terms of infrastructure projects in Brazil. And it might also bring a mandatory aspect to it that will have our underwriting business. So there's a sea of opportunities out there, and we are focused on analyzing all that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And something which was in the news recently and -- which has become bigger in the second half because it's of interest not only to economic agents but also to the government, and I'm talking about the unlocking of [judicial] guarantees by insurance guarantees. That will generate a new market, a whole new market where right now, local reinsurers are not operating or if they are, they are operating at a much lower scale than they could when we look at their balance sheets, so when you look at the quality of the underwriting these companies have and the level of solvency those companies have. Thank you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Wilson Toneto, IRB-Brasil Resseguros S.A. - Member of Executive Board and Executive VP of Risk &#38; Compliance [33]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mario (sic) [Ot&#195;&#161;vio], this is Toneto. Just to complement your question about credit -- tax credits you mentioned, you are correct. There was a complement of the tax credit, which had been put together on the previous years at the London office. So we're talking about a possible compensation taking place in Brazil. In 2018, we made an initial provision based on numbers coming from London. Then we reviewed that provision to adjust it to Brazilian regulation. The administration, the management is assessing that business plan to either confirm or not going forward. If we have any news, we'll share that with you going forward. This is a complement. This is not an effect which is going to happen every quarter. It's not recurring. It's a one-off, nonrecurring effect, okay? Nonrecurring, yes, correct.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just to give you a better idea of how we need to take this seriously. We need to look at the business model to know if we can use those credits on an efficient way, centralizing operations in London as if London were a true subsidiary of the Brazilian reinsurance company. So it includes all of that reassessment and checking the feasibility of costs, right? It needs to be cost-effective. Thank you, everyone.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unidentified Analyst, [34]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I think you're doing the right thing to address the issues. But my question has to do with the quantitative side. I have a couple of questions. Giovanna's question, I don't think it was clear whether risks are going down. I would like to address the same questions. When you look at your portfolio today -- and why do I ask the question? We're trying to find out how much you would have to adjust prices abroad. We would like to better understand that number. We would like to understand the quality of that portfolio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; My third question. I think Isabel left the company in October, and now she's back in the company. What happened in that case, given the recent problems the company had to go through?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Unidentified Company Representative, [35]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What you said is very important. Of course, you need as much information. That's our goal. We want to be more transparent. And it is a process you cannot put in place in just 3 months. We're doing our homework, which is to say we're trying to present appropriate numbers, effective data so that you can better analyze the company. That was the first thin&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Lokmat English30 Jun. 2020 14:20New Delhi, June 30 In one of the last reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government...&#60;p&#62;New Delhi, June 30 In one of the last reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government is set to free up pricing of all domestically produced natural gas that would help scale up local production from fields of ONGC, OIL, Reliance and Vedanta and help create a uniform gas market where the fuel is freely tradable on exchanges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The development comes soon after the launch of country's first online delivery-based gas trading platform - India Gas Exchange which is expected to play a big role in competitive price discovery for the natural gas that will come from different parts of the globe and from within India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Government sources said that discussions on lifting price restrictions on locally produced natural gas have started again and soon a decision would be taken about the timing of the new reform initiative. The current timing is considered ideal to free up gas prices as oil market after witnessing extreme volatility in March and April have stabilised and prices have remained soft and stable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A panel led by the NITI Aayog Vice Chairman has also suggested free-market pricing for natural gas produced from all fields to boost domestic output. Now with gas exchange also in place, the idea to expand on the idea of creating a gas based economy has gained strength:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We are looking at all proposals on bringing out domestic gas production from pricing regulations. A cabinet note proposing the changes would soon be finalised so that new system is put in place at the earliest,a said a government official privy to the development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also indicated towards the reform initiative last week when at a function he said that India will gradually end controls on gas pricing as it seeks to attract foreign investment and technology to lift local output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, any move to completely lift price regulation in the gas sector will be done gradually as has been suggested by the Kelkar Committee. This would mean that the present system of regulated gas pricing for domestic production would continue for at least three more years but during the period producers would be given freedom to sell a portion of the total output under negotiated pricing deals&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;( With inputs from IANS )&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Read Reference&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Why buying health insurance is important? All you need know</title>
            <link>https://www.zeebiz.com/personal-finance/news-why-buying-health-insurance-is-important-all-you-need-know-130214</link>
            <description> Despite the challenges posed by modern living, inclination towards staying fit suggests being healthy is not only aspirational but also achievable.&#60;p&#62;Do you feel people are becoming health conscious? Some people, especially in urban and semi-urban areas, exercise regularly. They focus on healthy eating. Theres yoga as well. Despite the challenges posed by modern living, such inclination towards staying fit suggests being healthy is not only aspirational but also achievable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The rise of digital and social media has played a huge part in helping people realize the importance of a healthy body. But accidents and viral and other acute ailments /diseases are unpredictable. Things can go wrong even if you are healthy. This is where the safety net of health insurance can be a beneficial proactive measure for financial security. Read ahead to know the need of a suitable health insurance plan for people of all ages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Understanding Health Insurance&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You choose your preferred health insurance company and select a plan with optimal coverage. You buy a policy  usually, for a year  by paying the insurance premium. The policy is bound by predefined terms and conditions. In case you need medical assistance due to an unfortunate event, the insurance company will bail you out financially, considering you meet the terms and conditions. You continue the coverage by renewing the policy. This is how health insurance works.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;See Zee Business Live TV streaming below:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Perception &#38; Reality&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;People have often resisted buying health insurance policies based on their one-dimensional perception. It is perceived that health insurance is for the elders  youngsters do not need to bother about it. Some people find the policies to be expensive and their terms and conditions complex to comprehend. Also, why worry when you are covered under your employers group insurance plan? Another assumption is that the savings in the bank will be enough to sail through a medical emergency. However, the reality is different.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Health insurance plans are equally important for the younger generation. Buying a plan early on in life can ensure better coverage at a lower premium. Buying a plan at an early age and renewing it on a regular basis also ensures that the waiting periods for various illnesses get completed. Nowadays, digital-first insurers have come up with affordable and easy-to-understand policies. You can choose from a variety of Health insurance plans, sum insureds, add on covers such as Accident Policy, Critical Illness, or a Hospital Cash policy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;by Taboolaby Taboola&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sponsored Links&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You May Like&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Vikings: Free Online Game&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you're over 50 - this game is a must! - No Install&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Vikings: Free Online Game&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Undo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Babbel&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Start speaking a new language in 3 weeks thanks to this app made in Germany&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Babbel&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Undo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Theres the option to buy Top-up and Super Top-up plans as well which offer coverage if expenses exceed beyond a threshold. A comprehensive health plan can ensure your savings remain in the bank as insurance will cover the bulk of the medical expenses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Why is Health Insurance Necessary?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sedentary lifestyle, rising pollution levels, increase of treatment cost and a gloomy uncertainty regarding prevailing and unknown health hazards have made buying health insurance necessary for the young and old. A wide-ranging health insurance plan can act as a shield against your savings. Your fixed deposit and other investments can keep growing steadily irrespective of a financial emergency, as the health policy will take care of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Instead of focusing on creating a massive medical emergency fund, you can buy a suitable health insurance policy and invest money for better financial returns. Health insurance also offers tax benefits based on the cover.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can avail the best treatment without worrying about the expenditure as top health insurance companies have tie-ups with prominent hospitals. Claims are settled in a cashless manner in these network hospitals leaving you free from the burden of arranging money during a crisis and getting entangled in the claim reimbursement procedure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Renew in Time&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A health insurance policy comes with an expiry date. For continuous coverage, it needs to be renewed before that date. Not renewing the policy in time leads to losing the benefits of renewal which include a No Claim Bonus, and most importantly the waiting period will be applicable all over again when you opt for a fresh insurance policy in future.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Do not push policy renewal to the last minute. Renew it earlier and take your time to review your health condition, coverage, and the insurers performance while doing so. You also have the option to choose a different health insurance company without foregoing the accrued benefits. While selecting a health insurance company, consider the cover, premium, as well as the insurance companys overall service.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Uninterrupted Coverage&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Look at health insurance as a necessary companion for financial security during unforeseen medical issues such as infections, accidents, and diseases. Buy the policy at an early age and keep renewing it in time for better and uninterrupted coverage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Authored by Biresh Giri, Appointed Actuary &#38; CRO, Acko General Insurance)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Top videos Zeebiz&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>COVID-19 is boosting demand for Universal Healthcare  but wont get us there</title>
            <link>https://www.medicalbuyer.co.in/covid-19-is-boosting-demand-for-universal-healthcare-but-wont-get-us-there/</link>
            <description> With the COVID-19 exposing the fragility of Indias healthcare system and the profiteering nature of corporate hospitals, there has been some optimistic expectation of substantial change in the healthcare scenario of the country post-pandemic. However, the cynic knows that there rarely is a trickle-up of activist sentiments and intellectual rationale into the &#195;&#169;lite corridors of power.&#60;p&#62;In fact Indias administration has its priorities sorted. The NITI Aayog is going ahead with its plans to create more private medical care centres by privatising district hospitals. Ayushman Bharat authorities seem to think its a good idea to allow the World Bank  the ideas of which have weakened government healthcare facilities in many countries  to influence their analyses. And major personalities in the government seem to be living in a parallel universe cleaved from reality. The refusal to acknowledge community transmission of COVID-19, the hydroxychloroquine debacle, led by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the downplaying of the migrants crisis are just some examples.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With such indifference, arrogance and denial going around, we cant expect the administration to be argumentatively convinced to implement progressive reform after the epidemic ends. That leaves us with influential citizens who often exert some influence on government policies. Have they at least woken up to the need for healthcare reform? Most privileged Indians indeed are furious with corporate hospitals. However, it seems much of this anger springs from the individually-oriented peeve that healthcare was made too pricey for them than the universally oriented principle that everyone deserves quality and affordable care.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In fact, the principle of everyone receiving adequate medical care irrespective of their ability to pay for it (as expressed in the 1946 Bhore Committee report) has hardly animated political and &#195;&#169;lite discourses beyond the early years of independence.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But that doesnt mean that people in India did not, as is often lamented, prioritise healthcare. They actually have always lobbied for good, affordable healthcare services  but only for themselves: i.e., as a group-based demand and not as a universalist demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consider the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). When it was proposed in the early 1950s for central government employees based in Delhi, the goal was gradually to scale it up to other cities and, over subsequent years, to most of the population. What happened is that the CGHS did expand to other regions  but was kept exclusive to government employees. Most of Indias elite officers climbed the ladder of this generous healthcare scheme, but on reaching the top they kick it away instead of sharing it with others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Though there was organised lobbying for medical services in the early decades of independence, it rarely was universalist: central government employees, Employment State Insurance Scheme members, railway employees and defence personnel all lobbied for better healthcare services for themselves and their families, and sought to restrict outsiders from accessing their facilities. Privileged Indians who did not belong to any of these groups used private nursing homes and private wards of government and charitable hospitals as their domains, and the super-privileged oftentimes just flew abroad. Later, in the 2000s, the rise of private multi-specialty hospitals and employment insurance made even the occasional middle-class visit to the government hospital a rarity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In short, over time, all privileged groups in India have managed to carve out more-or-less comfortable medical care niches for themselves depending on their paying capacities. And as they kicked the ladders away, they also looked the other way. For decades, the privileged have known but quietly ignored the disrespectful, at times abusive, nature of care provided to the underprivileged, as well as the fact that many of them slip into lifelong poverty due to healthcare expenses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is thus perhaps too optimistic to expect that the pandemic will effect a radical change in such entrenched attitudes. An indifferent political class and an inward-looking, injustice-inured privileged class together point to a status-quoist post-epidemic future for India when it comes to healthcare reform.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Healthcare reform here is universal healthcare (UHC), which in Amartya Sens words is an affordable dream. For India, this means major improvements in preventive and primary healthcare, and in the quality and quantity of care in government facilities, eventually halting the over-reliance of Indias millions on private facilities that are invariably driven by what activists call profits-over-people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Unfortunately, the much-publicised Ayushman Bharat scheme hasnt helped with respect to UHC. Insurance-based schemes are at best a temporary, stopgap measure, and at worst an expensive distraction from installing more equitable and sustainable structures of UHC. The underprivileged are not unwilling to pay for healthcare and preventive measures like nutrition, but our existing system makes them pay far more, sometimes catastrophically more, than they can afford. It is this asymmetry that UHC seeks to remedy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now, as we demand healthcare reform in a post-epidemic India, we must remember that the powerful and the &#195;&#169;lite are not suddenly going to be convinced of the towering idea that the underprivileged deserve the same kind of quality healthcare services and protection from financial stress as they enjoy. Public health experts have conducted lots of research and written several volumes on the urgent need for UHC, but the translation of research findings and expert recommendations into common sense is a political act, and cant be accomplished by academicians. UHC also needs the skills of many others like social scientists, activists, journalists and grassroots advocates working on the ground with communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mobilising and organising communities around specific goals is not exactly a skill that is taught in public health courses, but it is an important part of public health policy. Since academic alone cant achieve that, they need to reach out to others who can; an excellent example of such multidisciplinary, community-based advocacy in India is the work of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. Making eloquent arguments through scholarly papers and tweets is one of several steps required for the people and politicians to take academic work seriously.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Recent student-led agitations and women-led movements against discriminatory government policies have shown that a substantial number of ordinary Indians are receptive to progressive, universalist ideas and are willing to push politicians to work towards them. But public health goals will lose out on this willingness if the public at large is not mobilised to demand these goals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Considering COVID-19 wont be the last pandemic our generation encounters, and that serious climate-change-induced healthcare challenges are already knocking on our doors, the absence of UHC in a country of 1.3 billion means we are constantly on the cusp disaster. India cant afford to neglect putting in place, as quickly as possible, a robust UHC apparatus. And public health experts, on their part, cant afford to ignore putting in place strong alliances with community-based, politically active individuals and groups. Post-epidemic India needs UHC to stop being just a top-down expert recommendation and turn into a bottom-up grassroots demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Kiran Kumbhar is currently studying the history of science at Harvard University, focusing on the history of medicine in modern India.

Forex reserves recently climbed to a record $507.6 billion before falling slightly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Our forecast for a modest deficit could easily swing to a surplus if differential of global versus domestic economic activity widens, lending to slower recovery in core imports," Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Reporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Alexander Smith)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> According to the people cited earlier, Spain's Solarpack won 300 MW at 2.36 per unit, while Italy's Enel Green Power won 300MW at 2.37 per unit. Germany's IB Vogt won 300 MW at the same tariff. Canadian developer AMP Energy and New York-based Eden Renewables won 100MW and 300MW, respectively, at 2.37 per unit.&#60;p&#62; Bengaluru: Solar tariffs fell to a record low of 2.36 per unit at a recent Indian auction in which six foreign firms bagged most of the 2,000 MW of projects for which bids were called, people close to the development said. ReNew Power is the only Indian firm among the winners.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The lowest tariff until now had been 2.44 per unit, reached in a Solar Corporation of India (SECI) auction in May 2017, and again in July 2018.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; SECI is the nodal agency through which the ministry of new and renewable energy conducts wind and solar power auctions. It declined to confirm the winning tariffs in the latest auction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to the people cited earlier, Spain's Solarpack won 300 MW at 2.36 per unit, while Italy's Enel Green Power won 300MW at 2.37 per unit. Germany's IB Vogt won 300 MW at the same tariff. Canadian developer AMP Energy and New York-based Eden Renewables won 100MW and 300MW, respectively, at 2.37 per unit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ayana Renewable Power, which is backed by CDC Group (UK's development finance institution), won 300 MW at 2.38 per unit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Renew Power, an Indian company largely backed by foreign investors, won 400 MW at 2.38 per unit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The latest SECI tender had received an overwhelming response last week, with bids for more than 5,000 MW. Developers are free to choose where they want to set up their project in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Solar equipment costs have been falling very sharply in the last six months because of Covid-related demand depression around the world," said Vinay Rustagi, managing director of renewable energy consultancy firm Bridge to India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Developers are also anxious to win new projects because of the slowdown in power demand and the slow pace of auctions, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Vanilla solar tenders are becoming rare, as there is greater push for more complex round-the-clock and peak power schemes," Rustagi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Vietnam: PM Announces Name Of Wind Power Projects To Be Considered For Inclusion In The Electricity Development Planning</title>
            <link>http://www.mondaq.com/Article/960252</link>
            <description> On 25 June 2020, under Dispatch No.795/TTg-CN, the Prime Minister announced list of wind power projects and grids to be considered for inclusion in the national electricity development planning.&#60;p&#62;The list entails name, location, capacity, connection plans and conditions to release capacity of each project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The list focuses on 5 regions, of which the Southwest area (including Bac Lieu, Ben Tre, Soc Trang provinces) has the highest number of projects  3166.8 MW waiting to be included in the power master plan. Follow up is the Central Highlands (Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Dac Nong provinces) with 2432 MW. Next is the North Central region with 941.2 MW of wind projects concentrated mostly in Quang Tri province waiting to be included in the national power development planning.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All wind power projects in the South Central region are located in Ninh Thuan province. The South East region has only 1 project to be considered for inclusion  the Cong Ly Ba Ria Vung Tau project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dispatch 795 is expected to serve as a basis for the supervision of investment/construction process of wind power projects, so that these projects can quickly go into operation, supplement the electricity supply for the country and combat electricity shortage. Having a clear, official list of projects to be included in the master plan also helps to combat bribery/corruption among developers and relevant authorities  the latter enables low quality projects to be connected to the national grid thus subsequently damage the infrastructure of the distribution system and create financial loss for the buyer and consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ministry of Industry and Trade is responsible for making sure wind power projects and power grids connected to the national electricity system to be appraised in accordance with laws and can contribute to common economic efficiency. The Ministry must also ensure there will be no overload of power grid when putting these projects into operation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For names and more information of the wind power projects to be considered for inclusion in the electricity development planning, please do not hesitate to contact the author Dr. Oliver Massmann under omassmann@duanemorris.com.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dr. Oliver Massmann is the General Director of Duane Morris Vietnam LLC, Member to the Supervisory Board of PetroVietnam Insurance JSC and the only foreign lawyer presenting in Vietnamese language to members of the NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VIETNAM.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Disclaimer: This Alert has been prepared and published for informational purposes only and is not offered, nor should be construed, as legal advice.

            <title>Dairy brands ride tech wave to sail through Covid-19 crisis</title>
            <link>https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/strategy-and-management/dairy-brands-ride-tech-wave-to-sail-through-covid-19-crisis/76722233</link>
            <description> Amul, Nandini and Heritage Foods' investment in technology has helped them achieve hassle-free operations&#60;p&#62;When the Centre announced nationwide lockdown in the last week of March to contain the spread of Covid-19, it left several retailers engaged in the supply of essential items nervous.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RS Sodhi, the managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, popular by its dairy brand Amul, was not one of them, though. There will not be any problem, he declared with an air of confidence, back then. And, he walked, or is still walking the talk as the lockdown has stretched beyond three-weeks, and parts of India, including Mumbai, are still in gridlock.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amul brand, along with GCMMF s 18-member unions, touches the lives of 3.6 million farmers across about 18,700 villages of Gujarat. India's biggest dairy brand with one million-plus retail touchpoints required an infrastructure that can support data-intensive and demanding workloads. The cooperative giants faith and steady investment in the latest technology over the past 10 years has helped it wither the lockdown storm with little or no pain to dairy farmers or consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The dairy giant says its modern servers help in tracking the milk supply chain where any delay in the processing of milk can hurt the quality of the end product. We are probably the largest users of technology in the dairy system in the country. Right from procurement from farmers to touching the customers, it is completely touched by technology, Sodhi told ET.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company invests between Rs 600 crore and Rs 800 crore every year on technology that ensures technology adoption from sourcing milk from farmers; shifting to coolers, chilling the milk, and ensuring that the quality is maintained and then shifting to tankers to reach out to consumers. Technology is adopted in quality, online payment to farmers, and distribution management system for vendors to book orders as well as the adoption of enterprise resource planning software from SAP.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We do more than Rs 50,000 crore business every year, without technology you cannot be in the dairy industry, said Sodhi. The dairy mogul is using IBMs latest servers to run its core operations and deliver milk and dairy products across the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Technology has been helping Amul capture data points from the last Kirana store of the network and analyze varied datasets, IBM India Director (Systems) Viswanath Ramaswamy told ET. This helps the dairy giant to tweak the production of a certain product in sync with the fluctuation in market demand, with ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over a period of time, many smart analytics tools have been added to the technology support infrastructure to effectively manage Amul's supply chain, said Ramaswamy. In the coming years, the cooperatives, like many consumer product companies, will see the use of artificial intelligence in order to make better decisions, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nandini, the second-largest dairy brand after Amul, owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (KMF), is in the process of a technology overhaul. We are going in for the latest ERP technology in KMF and its units, said BC Sateesh, managing director of KMF.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Its member union Bamul in Bengaluru, for example, has adopted Oracle-based ERP. Our district unions have been using their own software, and some are switching to modern ones, he said. Nandini has an annual turnover of about Rs 14,000 crore, and sources milk from about nine lakh farmers across about 254,000 villages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;KMFs Mother Dairy unit in Bengaluru, Sateesh added, has cloud-based ERP, and all its new milk processing units are end-to-end automated with Siemens technology. Tech adoption, he said, has helped in uninterrupted supply to consumers, while at the same time, farmers are relieved their milk got marketed even in a lockdown situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hyderabad-based private sector dairy brand, Heritage Foods, is also investing big on technology. A user of IBM infrastructure, its executive director Brahmani Nara said: SAP-integrated solution enables timely automated milk payments to village level suppliers. We have honoured hassle-free 100% milk procurement and payments to farmers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Technology, she added, has become the backbone in maintaining the business. During the lockdown, the firm ensured door delivery of products, with leads captured using WhatsApp and social media.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to her, milk transport vehicles are monitored through GPS Solutions to ensure they reach their destination in time and to maintain consistent quality. "Technology has become the backbone in maintaining business discipline and we were able to smoothly close our annual accounts in time and adhere to all compliances, despite relaxations by the Government," she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>NMC clears path for electric buses</title>
            <link>https://www.thehitavada.com/Encyc/2020/7/1/NMC-clears-path-for-electric-buses.html</link>
            <description> A view of the proceedings of Transport Committee of NMC that okayed induction of electric buses in fleet of Aapli Bus.&#60;p&#62;The path is cleared for induction of electric vehicles in fleet of Aapli Bus of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). A meeting of Transport Committee was held specially on Tuesday wherein a resolution was adopted authorising civic body to go ahead with placing orders for the buses for which Central Government is ready to provide grants. NMC had floated tender for acquiring electric buses, 40 in number, and M/s EVEY Transport Pvt. Ltd submitted its bids for running these buses at Rs 72.99/km. After opening the bids, NMC engaged in negotiations and subsequently the company lowered its rate to Rs 66.33/km.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The rates were personally negotiated by Municipal Commissioner Tukaram Mundhe with senior officials of the company. As per the policy, Union Ministry of Heavy Industries is providing grants to civic body for purchasing the electric vehicles. The aim is to cut down the operations cost for public utility vehicles. Further with induction of electric vehicles the burden of petrol and diesel would gradually reduce providing affordability and reducing expenditure for the civic bodies that are struggling to cope with mounting expenses. NMC as per information is going to get aid of Rs. 45 lakh per bus while actual cost of the vehicle is Rs. 1.48 crores. As such NMC stands to get funds from Central Government to tune of Rs. 18 crores.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Central Government was ready to allocate 100 electric buses to NMC however giving the paucity of funds then Municipal Commissioner Abhijit Bangar had restricted their numbers to just 40. Notwithstanding the sweet deal as maximum burden was being shared by Centre, even for NMC raising the balance funds could have been a heavy task. The project is being pushed by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari who has already provided five electric buses to NMC.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They are currently deployed by civic body for purpose of ladies special and designated as Tejaswini. Given the falling rates of solar energy even the cost of charging for these buses is very affordable plus they can run for long hours without need for recharging. Meanwhile, Narendra alias Balya Borkar, Chairperson, Transport Committed, directed civic officials to immediately sign the agreement with Union Ministry of Heavy Industries for purchase of electric buses. He said that the induction of electric buses would improve the air quality in city and drastically improve the travellling for citizens. Borkar also instructed officials to ensure that all the contractual employees of Aapli Buses are paid remuneration as per standing rules. The meeting was held at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Hall at NMC Central Office, Civil Lines. Members Nitin Sathawne, Narendra Walde, Vishaka Bante, Manisha Dhawde, Vaishali Rohankar, Rupali Thakur along with Shakeel Niyaji, Transport Manager, Dr Ranjana Lade, Municipal Secretary, Ravindra Pagey, Administrative Officer, Arun Pipurde, Labour Officer, Vinay Bharadwaj, Yogesh Lunge, Mechanical Officer, were also present at the meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Chinese solar imports to be exempted from BCD if PPA signed earlier</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/chinese-solar-imports-to-be-exempted-from-bcd-if-ppa-signed-earlier/76722204</link>
            <description> The decision is subject to the approval of the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry, said RK Singh, minister of state for power and new and renewable energy&#60;p&#62;New Delhi: Chinese imports for public solar power projects will be exempted from the basic customs duty if the power purchase agreements were signed before the implementation of the duty, the Ministry of New and Renewable&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Energy ( MNRE ) said on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The decision is subject to the approval of the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry, RK Singh, minister of state for power and new and renewable energy, told renewable energy companies at a meeting called by his ministry to convey the decision.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In case the finance ministry does not allow such a provision, Singh assured the companies that the MNRE will allow developers to claim reimbursements for imports from China, provided their PPAs are signed before August 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The latter route would mean that there is an understanding between the solar developers and the government that the projects cost more than the allocated budget at the time of closing the deal, and hence compensation will be provided to the developers via the distribution companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Last week, Singh had told media persons that the government planned to levy 15-20% duty that would rise to 40% in a year's time, to reduce dependence on China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Called a grandfather clause, the move comes as a relief to local manufacturers who were surprised by the government's decision to impose such a duty. About 80% of solar imports come from China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, developers have complained about a previous grandfather clause not being honoured. We have seen a similar clause for the pass-through of the safeguard duty, but have not seen any money from the state discoms yet, said an industry executive present at the meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Smaller solar companies have also requested an exemption for private PPAs. The cost for private deals which are already signed will increase, leading to a lot of complications in the already negotiated deals, said a developer, who did not wish to be identified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Singh also said that the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) is expected by September, which is expected to boost domestic manufacturing in India. All projects using solar components will only be allowed from manufacturers on this list, which will be implemented from October 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> At 08:45 am, Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) were trading 11.5 points or 0.11 per cent higher at 10,247, indicating a flat start for the Indian market on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62;Vodafone Idea's pre-tax loss rose 73 per cent to Rs 11,742 crore in the March quarter of 2019-20 owing to exceptional expenses. The telecom firm had posted a pre-tax loss of Rs 6,758 crore in the same quarter last year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 10,529 crore in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2019-20 (Q4FY20) because of a drop in crude oil prices, the impact of the lockdown, and exchange losses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Carlyle Group on Wednesday announced that it will invest $235 million for approximately 25 per cent stake in Nxtra Data Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel engaged in the data centre business.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jindal Steel &#38; Power (Mauritius), or JSPML, a subsidiary of Naveen Jindal-led ) said on Tuesday that it has accepted a binding offer from Templar Investments to divest its entire stake in its Oman asset, Jindal Shadeed Iron and Steel (JSIS Oman).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Kishore Biyani-led Future group has zeroed in on SBI General to sell its majority stake in the general insurance joint venture, and on Premji Invest for its life insurance venture stake, by Business Standard.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RITES Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.28 per cent decline in consolidated profit at Rs 143.93 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

Further ease in lockdown, attractive financing schemes, and expectations of normal monsoon could support automobile companies to build-on the demand recovery seen in May, and post improved sales figures on a monthly basis for June 2020,.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;FMCG major HUL Chairman Sanjiv Mehta on Tuesday cautioned that the "risk of recession remains real" but it must not be taken as a foregone conclusion while stating that the path back to growth will depend on a range of drivers, including the trajectory of coronavirus, effectiveness of containment efforts and economic steps taken by governments, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Chinese imports for solar power projects to be exempted from customs duty if PPAs are signed before implementation of the duty: MNRE</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/chinese-imports-for-solar-power-projects-to-be-exempted-from-customs-duty-if-ppas-are-signed-before-implementation-of-the-duty-mnre/articleshow/76722121.cms</link>
            <description> The decision is subject to the approval of the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry, said RK Singh, minister of state for power and new and renewable energy, told renewable energy companies at a meeting called by his ministry to convey the decision.&#60;p&#62; Chinese imports for public solar power projects will be exempted from the basic customs duty if the power purchase agreements were signed before the implementation of the duty, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( MNRE ) said on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The decision is subject to the approval of the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry, said RK Singh , minister of state for power and new and renewable energy, told renewable energy companies at a meeting called by his ministry to convey the decision.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In case the finance ministry does not allow such a provision, Singh assured the companies that the MNRE will allow developers to claim reimbursements for imports from China, provided their PPAs are signed before August 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The latter route would mean that there is an understanding between the solar developers and the government that the projects cost more than the allocated budget at the time of closing the deal, and hence compensation will be provided to the developers via the distribution companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Last week, Singh had told media persons that the government planned to levy 15-20% duty that would rise to 40% in a year's time, to reduce dependence on China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Called a grandfather clause, the move comes as a relief to local manufacturers who were surprised by the government's decision to impose such a duty. About 80% of solar imports come from China.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, developers have complained about a previous grandfather clause not being honoured. We have seen a similar clause for the pass-through of the safeguard duty, but have not seen any money from the state discoms yet, said an industry executive present at the meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Smaller solar companies have also requested an exemption for private PPAs. The cost for private deals which are already signed will increase, leading to a lot of complications in the already negotiated deals, said a developer, who did not wish to be identified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Singh also said that the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) is expected by September, which is expected to boost domestic manufacturing in India. All projects using solar components will only be allowed from manufacturers on this list, which will be implemented from October 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Clean energy investment can support countries to Recover Better: SEforALL</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111536-clean-energy-investment-can-support-countries-to-recover-better-seforall</link>
            <description> As countries continue to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, a new guide by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) (SEforALL.org) shows how clean energy investment can support countries to 'Recover Better', and use this unique moment to reset their economies and close energy access gaps.&#60;p&#62;According to The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide for African Countries (bit.ly/2Bn7lGG) that was released by SEforALL today, countries that commit to an ambitious recover better strategy today can deliver long term economic growth, new jobs, and sustainable energy for all in the long-term.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is particularly key for Africa after COVID-19 has highlighted the deep regional divide on energy access progress. Africa is a region full of promise and a growing economic powerhouse, yet this progress is stifled without access to sufficient, reliable and affordable energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The latest data (bit.ly/2Af8cIS) on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7)  access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030  shows that progress in Africa is still off track to meet global targets. 565 million people still lack access to electricity, and a further 900 million lack clean cooking solutions. The pandemic risks setting progress even further behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;By acting on the enabling measures put forward in The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide, countries across Africa will benefit from increased GDP, affordable energy provision, and improved agriculture, gender and health outcomes. This re-set can also spark progress at the speed and scale needed to meet SDG7 and help put the global economy on a trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has changed the world as we know it. As countries rebuild economies from the impact of the pandemic, they are faced with a unique, once in a generation opportunity to 'Recover Better' with sustainable energy", said Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and Co-Chair of UN-Energy. "There has never been a better time to invest in clean, efficient renewable energy. Countries that recover better with sustainable energy will see the pay off in the form of resilient economies, new jobs, and faster energy development. By making this investment, African countries can develop a competitive advantage."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the launch of the guide, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, said: "COVID-19 has presented a unique opportunity to accelerate the transition to that clean, affordable, reliable and renewable energy source offered by the sun. Nigeria is committed to the full utilization of this abundant solar energy source. The Federal Government has already removed fossil fuel subsidies and included 5 million solar connections in our post-COVID economic sustainability plan  first steps to new jobs and a cleaner, healthier environment. We commend Sustainable Energy for All for producing this practical 'Recover Better' guide that will help African governments close the energy access gap and deliver economic growth for the benefit of our people."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The global economy is increasingly being powered by clean and efficient sources of energy. According to research, the dollar for dollar investments in clean energy creates three times the number of jobs compared to fossil fuels. Every 1,000 customers connected to decentralized energy solutions - solar home systems or solar mini-grids - supports approximately 25 jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also speaking in support of the guide, Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General, United Nations, said: "Access to sustainable energy is pivotal to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement. As we work to recover better from the impacts of&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19, African countries have the opportunity to drive faster progress on the energy transition with efficient, renewable energy that protects the most vulnerable, delivers sustainable growth and support climate action."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Riccardo Puliti, World Bank Global Director for Energy and Extractive Industries and Regional Director for Infrastructure in Africa, said: "Access to energy is crucial for Africa to recover from the ongoing health, economic and social challenges caused by the pandemic. We welcome this new guide from Sustainable Energy for All that outlines ways in which African countries can seize this unique moment, and in return, unleash economic growth with clean, sustainable energy."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As countries seek to recover better, SEforALL has highlighted key policy measures that governments should adopt to ensure a successful energy transition in this period. This includes:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ease of doing business: Governments should create a supportive business environment that ensures investments are driven as fast as possible, including significantly reducing red tape, reducing the number of permits required and time it takes to get permits/waivers (if available) for renewable energy and clean cooking equipment and appliances.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Set robust policies and empower national institutions to drive development: Governments need to work now to establish or empower institutions such as regulators and rural electrification agencies to ensure the right frameworks are in place to successfully drive the development of renewables, increased electrification and access to clean cooking.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eliminate fossil fuel subsidies: With the price of oil the lowest it has been for 18 years; governments must take this opportunity to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. When the price of fossil fuels rises again, governments should refrain from re-introducing the subsidy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Move towards cost-reflective tariffs: The natural tendency for countries will be to cut the cost of electricity, but this should be avoided. The reality is that electricity is largely consumed by wealthier residentials or by industrial/commercial clients. Governments should allow cost-reflective tariffs that allow utilities to perform better and increases investments in energy access and clean energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Other key elements outlined in The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide for African Countries include: Invest in robust data, declare a moratorium on new coal-fired power, invest in energy efficiency and invest in people so they can take advantage of new clean energy jobs.

The guide is part of a series which includes guides for countries in the Caribbean region and Southeast Asia region due to be released soon.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(With Inputs from APO)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MoU signed between Indianoil, NTPC Ltd, and SDMC for Waste to Energy plant in Delhi</title>
            <link>https://www.5dariyanews.com/news/298382-MoU-signed-between-Indianoil-NTPC-Ltd-and-SDMC-for-Waste-to-Energy-plant-in-Delhi</link>
            <description> Project has potential to carve out a greener and energy efficient future for Aatmanirbhar Bharat, says Shri Dharmendra Pradhan&#60;p&#62;Web Admin&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;5 Dariya News&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A MoU was signed today on Waste to Energy plant at Okhla, Delhi, between Indian Oil, NTPC Ltd and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The ceremony was witnessed by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &#38; Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Shri RK Singh, Minister of State (I/c) for Power and New &#38; Renewable Energy, and Shri Anil Baijal, Lt. Governor of Delhi. Secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Tarun Kapoor, Shri Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IndianOil, Senior officials from the Ministry of Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas, SDMC, NTPC Limited, and IndianOil were also present. Under the MoU, IndianOil, SDMC and NTPC shall come together to develop a demonstration Waste-to-energy Plant at Okhla landfill site in Delhi, using Gasification technology. This Plant shall process 17500 tons per annum of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) produced from combustible components of Municipal Waste to generate syngas which shall in turn be used to generate electricity.Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a major issue in Delhi, and this Energy plant will open the path towards the solution. He congratulated IndianOil, SDMC and NTPC for coming together for this landmark project that has the potential to carve out a greener and more energy efficient future for the Atmanirbhar Bharat as envisioned by the Honble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Pradhan said that there is an existing model of providing offtake guarantee, under the SATAT scheme for compressed biogas production plants. He said that the venture would succeed, as there are guarantees from two Maharatna companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He called for quick expansion and replication of such pilot project in other places also. The Minister said that gas generation from waste will also help in cutting imports of petroleum products and saving precious foreign exchange. Shri Pradhan asked IOCL, NTPC to join hands with the Department of Science and Technology, to develop Hydrogen Fuel technology. India has large appetite for the energy, and development of Hydrogen technology can be done on the Commercial scale in the country. Shri R.K.Singh said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi always talks about breaking silos and this is a good example of two ministries coming together, for a good public cause. The problem of Solid Municipal waste is rampant throughout the country, more so in Tier II and III cities. Large mounds of wastes are not only health hazards and environmental concerns, but also big eyesores. He said that the Ministry has taken a decision to support such plants, irrespective of the cost of the production of gas from them vis-&#195;&#160;-vis other means. He said that technology being used in the Delhi plant, will not only result in less emission, but also provide usable residues.Shri Anil Baijal said that solid waste management is a big challenge in the national capital. On the one hand, there is a legacy of big mounds of waste accumulated over several decades, while on the other hand, there is not enough space for the current waste. The city has the capacity to process only half of its waste. The commissioning of such plants will not only provide a clean and environment-friendly way to handle solid wastes, but also generate gas and manure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Calls for IspatiIrada to promote appropriate usage of steel to drive inclusive development with sustainability&#60;p&#62;Web Admin&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;5 Dariya News&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New Delhi, 30 Jun 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Steel and Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas today chaireda webinar on IspatiIrada: Enhancing steel usage with focus on construction and infrastructure sectors. Minister of State for Steel Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Secretary, Steel, Senior officers from the Ministry of Steel, subject experts, industry leaders, academicians, researchers, large users and regulatorsalso participated in the webinar.Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that the steel industry plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a nation. He said that India has become second largest producer of steel in the world, and has the capacity to build quality products, but per-capita consumption of steel in the country is almost one-third of the global average, and there is immense potential upside to it.Talking about the IspatiIrada, theMinister said, Ispat is not just a material but it is a state of mind. India has an 'IspatiIrada'to be an inclusive developed nation.He said that it is not a mere slogan, but a manifestation of the Governments determination to strengthen the economy, ameliorate the condition of the poor, improve environment and enhance employment opportunities. He further stated that the collaborative branding campaign IspatiIrada has the objective of promoting appropriate steel usage in the country,and aims to leverage usage of steel as an easy-to-use, environment-friendly, cost-effective, affordable and strength-giving material.The Minister said that we have to identify the opportunities and challenges in, increasing steel consumption. He said that Ministry of Steel has already discussed with key infrastructure ministries about more steel usage, and is engaging with various departments, state governments and other stakeholders. He called for Make in Steel through a transition to more steel intensive construction. India is investing big time in creating infrastructure for future across sectors like railways, roads, civil aviation, energy, which will further provide impetus to the steel consumption in the country. He informed that a working group will be set up which will regularly monitor the steps being taken to enhance the steel usage. He asked the Webinar participants to come with a few solid recommendations, which would be implemented.In his address, Shri Kulaste said that there is wide scope of increasing the consumption of steel in the country, particularly in the rural areas. The Consumption of steel in the rural areas is almost one-quarter of the national average. He said that the increase in steel consumption will give impetus to the economic activities, help in improving the environment, and provide employment opportunities. He said that the Government has announced National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs. 103 lakh crore in the infrastructure sector, and this will lead to enhanced steel demand. Ministry of Steel is already in talks with other departments to increase steel usage. Quoting the example of Japan, which is earthquake-prone and uses upto 80% steel in its structures, Shri Kulaste said that the Steel provides strength and stability to them. He also said the steel industry will have to find ways to reduce the cost of construction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Welcome to ETMarkets Morning, the show about money, business and markets.&#60;p&#62;I am Saloni Goel, and here is what we have to start your day.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; MNCs pay dollops of dividends after lifting of DDT&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Premji Invest, SBI explore bid for Future Generali&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; India sees current account surplus after 13 years&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; AND&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Voda Idea reports mega Q4 loss at Rs 11,643 Cr&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And there is more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But first, a quick glance at the state of the markets...&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Nifty futures on Singapore Exchange traded 32 points higher at 7 am (IST) signalling a positive start ahead for Dalal Street&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ELSEWHERE&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Asian stocks started the new quarter in a muted fashion, as investors assessed mixed data on the global economy. Shares edged lower in Japan on low volumes, but stocks ticked higher in Shanghai and Sydney. South Korea saw a bigger advance. Hong Kong is closed for a holiday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; The S&#38;P 500 rallied on Tuesday to finish higher and secure its biggest quarterly percentage gain in more than two decades as improving economic data bolstered investor beliefs that a stimulus-backed rebound for the US economy was on the horizon. Dow rose 217 points, or 0.85%, the S&#38;P500 47.05 points, or 1.54%, and the Nasdaq 184.61 points, or 1.87%&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; IN CURRENCY MART&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; The rupee on Tuesday settled 7 paise higher at 75.51 against the US dollar tracking gains in the domestic equity market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; The US dollar held on to gains against the yen on Wednesday, while the euro was hemmed into a narrow range by traders. Sterling held on firmly to the previous session's gains, and Swiss franc perked up against the greenback.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; IN OIL MARKET&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Oil prices rose after an industry report showed crude inventories in the US fell much more than expected. Brent crude rose 33 cents, or 0.8%, to $41.60 a barrel while WTI crude gained 42 cents, or 1.1%, to $39.69 a barrel\&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; AND IN BULLION&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#62;&#62; Domestic gold prices rose to Rs 48,559 from Rs 48,534 per 10 gm while silver made marginal gains from Rs 48,556 to settle at Rs 48,600 per kg. In international markets, gold surged to its highest in nearly 8 years on Tuesday amid mounting fears of a resurgence of new coronavirus cases. Spot gold jumped 0.5% to $1,779.44 an ounce.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All in all, Dalal Street looks headed for a positive start. On Tuesday, Nifty50 formed a small bearish candle on the daily chart after forming indecisive Doji candles for two consecutive sessions. Analysts said the market is losing strength and the bias is turning negative.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; DO WATCH OUT FOR&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; o June Auto sales data, and&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; o Manufacturing PMI print for June&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; LET ME NOW GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP on some of the top news we are tracking at this hour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  The big dividend rush by MNCs is on. Taking advantage of the absence of dividend distribution tax, many multinational companies have been doling out large dividends over the past two months. For instance, Pfizer paid a special dividend of Rs 320 per share, or 3,200%, against Rs 22.50 last year. Sanofi India Rs 349 against last year's Rs 66.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  India recorded a current account surplus of $600 million or 0.1% of GDP for the March quarter against a $4.5 billion deficit a year ago thanks to a shrinkage in trade deficit and a rise in net invisible receipts, RBI data showed. The last time the current account was in surplus was over a decade ago in March 2007.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Wipro's billionaire founder Azim Premji's investment firm Premji Invest and SBI General Insurance are exploring a joint bid to acquire Future Generali. Future Group is keen to sell its stake in the insurance venture and Italy's Generali Group is said to be considering an exit from India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Vodafone Idea posted a whopping Rs 11,643.5 crore loss for March quarter, its seventh successive three-month period in the red, hurt by loss of subscribers, high finance costs and a one-time charge related mainly to its statutory dues. The telco warned of continued threat to its viability unless it is allowed to pay the AGR dues in instalments.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;  Indian banks have set aside Rs 13,653.2 crore for provisions towards moratorium and deferments related to Covid-19 in March quarter.

            <title>Australia: Investors Give Bright Spark To First Renewable Energy Zone In NSW</title>
            <link>http://www.mondaq.com/australia/renewables/960234/investors-give-bright-spark-to-first-renewable-energy-zone-in-nsw</link>
            <description> The NSW Government has received a highly positive response from investors following plans to release the first renewable energy zone in New South Wales.&#60;p&#62;The call for proposals received an overwhelming interest from investors, well beyond the proposed 3 GW renewable energy plan, with investor interest totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The NSW Government first announced their intention to generate funding for the 3 GW Renewable Energy Zone ( REZ ) in May 2020, and called for registrations of interest from solar, wind and energy storage companies. With registrations only open until 5 June 2020, the response has been extremely positive in the short timeframe and has encouraged the NSW Government to increase its own investment in the project. Energy Minister Matt Kean MP confirmed that the NSW Government would commit a further $31.6 million, bringing the total budget to over $40 million, four times the original funding proposal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Central-West Orana zone program is designed to unlock a pipeline of large-scale renewable energy projects around Dubbo and replace the aging thermal-generation fleet. As the first of three proposed renewable energy zones in NSW forming part of the NSW Government's Electricity Strategy, the pilot REZ is expected to generate $4.4 billion in investment, create over 450 construction jobs and will be capable of powering 1.3 million homes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The objective of each REZ is to provide for the coordinated development of new grid infrastructure in energy rich areas, to connect multiple generators (such as solar and wind farms) in the same location. They also provide opportunities for upfront planning and early community engagement. Minister Kean MP has stated the REZ will be "the modern day equivalent of a traditional power station" and will deliver 3 GW of solar and wind generation, which has been identified as the "cheapest type of new reliable generation" by the NSW Government, likely putting downward pressure on electricity prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Central-West was chosen as the pilot REZ due to the variety of approved or planned projects, the low building cost and the strong access to both solar and wind resources in the region. Following implementation of the pilot REZ, the NSW Government also has plans to deliver renewable energy zones in the New England and South-West regions, in line with the Australian Energy Market Operator's Integrated System Plan.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Along with investment funding, the $31.6 million boost from the NSW Government will be used to coordinate the energy deployment with the REZ and help identify locations where further infrastructure is required. It is hoped that this extra funding will allow for a greater strategic coordination of the development to ensure the REZ suits both developers and the local community.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Energy Corporation of NSW will oversee the development of the REZ, while a $16.2 million feasibility study will be carried out by TransGrid to assess the technical and commercial option of new voltage transmission lines. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency ( ARENA ) will provide further support to TransGrid, dedicating $5 million in funding for their study in the hope to pave the way for future REZs across the National Energy Market by creating a blueprint for new zones, securing new jobs and cheaper energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Construction of the pilot REZ is set to begin in 2022 after extensive consultation with communities. Community consultation will occur both in the strategic planning stage to develop the long-term strategy and objectives for each zone as well as on a project-by-project basis as part of the State Significant Development ( SSD ) assessment process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Importantly, the planning approval pathways for REZ projects will not change from the status quo and all projects will be required to prepare environmental impact assessment documentation under the NSW SSD process, and may also require approval from the Commonwealth under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Domestic gas pricing reform on cards, controls may be lifted</title>
            <link>https://www.sify.com/finance/domestic-gas-pricing-reform-on-cards-controls-may-be-lifted-news-news-ug4jkQbgjgfgd.html</link>
            <description> Source: IANS Author: Subhash Narayan Last Updated: Wed, Jul 1st, 2020, 09:37:45hrs&#60;p&#62;New Delhi: In one of the last reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government is set to free up pricing of all domestically produced natural gas that would help scale up local production from fields of ONGC, OIL, Reliance and Vedanta and help create a uniform gas market where the fuel is freely tradable on exchanges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The development comes soon after the launch of country's first online delivery-based gas trading platform - India Gas Exchange which is expected to play a big role in competitive price discovery for the natural gas that will come from different parts of the globe and from within India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Government sources said that discussions on lifting price restrictions on locally produced natural gas have started again and soon a decision would be taken about the timing of the new reform initiative. The current timing is considered ideal to free up gas prices as oil market after witnessing extreme volatility in March and April have stabilised and prices have remained soft and stable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A panel led by the NITI Aayog Vice Chairman has also suggested free-market pricing for natural gas produced from all fields to boost domestic output. Now with gas exchange also in place, the idea to expand on the idea of creating a gas based economy has gained strength:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We are looking at all proposals on bringing out domestic gas production from pricing regulations. A cabinet note proposing the changes would soon be finalised so that new system is put in place at the earliest,a said a government official privy to the development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also indicated towards the reform initiative last week when at a function he said that India will gradually end controls on gas pricing as it seeks to attract foreign investment and technology to lift local output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, any move to completely lift price regulation in the gas sector will be done gradually as has been suggested by the Kelkar Committee. This would mean that the present system of regulated gas pricing for domestic production would continue for at least three more years but during the period producers would be given freedom to sell a portion of the total output under negotiated pricing deals (market determined) with their customers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The NDA government's reform initiatives ever since coming to power has already allowed free gas pricing for production coming from small and marginal blocks, difficult high pressure/deep water blocks and all production coming under the newly bid blocks under the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the pricing and marketing of gas from Pre-NELP exploration blocks and those under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) is still regulated. This regulation will be lifted gradually, once the new policy is approved.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The current gas pricing method for pre-NELP and NELP blocks is based on a 2014 government-set formula that takes average rates from global trading hubs to determine domestic prices twice a year - in April and then in October. Under the formula, the current gas price is at $ 2.39 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the six-month period beginning April 1. Gas producers have been critical of this low pricing that adversely impacts investments in the upstream sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"It's about time when government frees up gas pricing, if it is serious about developing a gas based economy in the country. Apart from lifting pricing restrictions on domestic gas, the government should also do away with price caps for market determined gas price. This would enable market forces and competition to offer best available prices to consumers," said a senior official of a private sector oil and gas explorer who did not wish to be named.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At present, producers can charge market rates for gas from deep sea and other difficult fields but rates must stay below a government-prescribed ceiling that's linked to the prices of alternative fuels. The price ceiling is currently at $5.61 per mmBtu. The new policy will look into this ceiling price as well, sources said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is looking at investor friendly policies in oil and gas sector to attract investments that has remained miniscule for last several years. Due to this, domestic oil production has stagnated while gas production has not picked up in a big way. In fact, domestic gas output shrank by 5 per cent in FY20 and has fallen by about 18 per cent in the first two months of current fiscal pushing up the demand of relatively expensive imported liquefied natural gas. The government is aiming to increase gas production by two-and-a-half times by 2030, which would help raise the fuel's share in the country's energy mix to 15 per cent from the current 6 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At present, out of 310 exploration blocks awarded so far under various bidding rounds (discovered field, pre-NELP &#38; NELP), 189 blocks/fields are operational. 17 blocks under nomination are being operated by ONGC and OIL. Petroleum Exploration Licences (PEL) for domestic exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas were granted under four different regimes over a period time: nomination basis -- PEL, Pre-NELP discovered field, Pre-NELP exploration blocks and New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As many as 117 companies are operating in these blocks post the ninth NELP round. This has at least 11 public sector undertakings, 58 private firms and 48 foreign companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;( Subhash Narayan can be contacted at subhash.n@ians.in)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Responding to the current economic downturn can simultaneously benefit the economy, the environment, and our communities.

            <title>India and Bhutan Form First-Ever Joint Venture for a 600 MW Hydro Project</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/india-bhutan-jv-hydro-project/</link>
            <description> The project is likely to be completed in the second half of 2025&#60;p&#62;India and Bhutan have formed their first-ever joint venture to develop a hydropower project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 600 MW project will be located on the Kholongchhu river in Trashiyangtse district of eastern Bhutan. The project will be developed by Kholongchhu Hydroelectric Limited, a joint venture formed between Druk Green Power Corporation of Bhutan and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited of India. The project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Kholongchhu Hydro Energy Limited has also signed a concession agreement with the government of Bhutan for the development of the project. The project will consist of an underground powerhouse of four 150 MW turbines, which will be impounded with water from a concrete gravity dam with a height of 95 meters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The hydropower sector is the primary area of cooperation between the two countries. So far, India has funded four hydropower projects in Bhutan, which include 36 MW Chukha hydropower project, 60 MW Kurichhu hydropower project, 1,020 MW Tala hydropower project, and 720 MW Mangdechu hydropower project totaling about 2.1 GW of hydroelectric power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the International Hydropower Association recently released its 2020 Hydropower Status Report, which notes that India overtook Japan as the fifth largest hydropower generator in the world with an installed capacity of 50.07 GW. The IHAs report also showed that globally, hydropower generated 4,306 TW of power in 2019, the highest contribution from any renewable energy source recorded in history. The report also noted that the largest hydro project commissioned in 2019 was the 720 MW Mangdechu Project in Bhutan, funded by the Indian government to power the countrys market and to export any surplus power to India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In March 2019, India decided to include large hydropower projects over 25 MW under the portfolio of renewable energy. This move by the government added 43 GW of existing hydropower projects to the renewables basket.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Mercom India Research, as of March 31, 2020, large hydropower projects of 45.7 GW are operational in the country, accounting for 12.3% of the total installed power capacity in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>2 HDFC funds downgraded</title>
            <link>https://www.morningstar.in/posts/58782/2-hdfc-funds-downgraded.aspx</link>
            <description> HDFC Equity and HDFC Top 100 had a good run until the first half of 2019.&#60;p&#62;Performance tripped in the second half, which eventually dented their long-term track record. As a result, over 5-year and 10-year time frames, the funds have been underperforming their respective benchmarks as well as category peers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Is the downgrade because of the latest performance numbers? No.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In fact, I would like to point out that this is not the first time HDFC Equity and HDFC top 100 have witnessed severe underperformance. There were periods in 2013 and 2015 as well. And I remember encountering severe criticism when I reiterated the Gold rating on both funds in 2015.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So what changes now? I see an enhanced risk to the strategy, which leads me to downgrade both to Silver.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prashant Jains long-term investment approach, policy of staying fully invested, and backing his convictions when the strategy is out of favour, has often delivered pleasing results over the long term. But there are also periods when his Jains valuation-conscious approach is out of favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Does that mean his approach is faulty?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the contrary. The process is robust with research at its core. Prashant adopts a hands on approach to research, to get an in-depth understanding of the business and ferret out companies with robust business models, clean balance sheets, and competitive strengths. Though the bottom-up style is clearly integral to Jains investment style, the top-down isnt ignored either.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since relative and absolute valuation methods are used to pick stocks, his style can be described broadly as growth at a reasonable price.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Given his valuation-conscious approach, Jain increased exposure to segments which are attractively valued, such as financial services, utilities, energy and capital goods. This is consistent with his belief that after a massive sell-off, its value which outperforms. He continues to remain underweight on the consumer staples sector given high valuation, and the consumer discretionary space as he believes that COVID-19 will dent demand there. He trimmed exposure to consumer cyclicals to zero much before the segment witnessed a downturn.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The portfolios are poised to benefit from the turnaround in the economic environment, but will continue to witness challenges until the trend reverses. To add to it, his investments in public sector enterprises have not yielded desired results.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A point worth noting is that he has always highlighted the risk inherent to the NBFC segment and has avoided investing in it. To his credit, the events in the NBFC space played out as he anticipated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HDFC Top 100&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Category: Equity Large Cap&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Category Index: S&#38;P BSE 100&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fund Benchmark Index: IISL Nifty 100&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Analyst Rating: Silver&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Star Rating: 2 stars&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fund Manager: Prashant Jain&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Date of Analysis: June 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Equity Holdings (May 2020): 50&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Top 6 holdings (May 2020): RIL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, L&#38;T&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For this fund, Prashant is clearly mindful of the benchmark as he targets having matched stock positions of at least 60%. Having said that, he doesnt shy away from taking significant underweight/ overweight positions at the sector level when he spots opportunities. For instance, his top picks such as ICICI Bank, ITC, and Infosys are overweight versus the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HDFC Equity&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Category: Equity Multi Cap&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Category Index: S&#38;P BSE 500&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fund Benchmark Index: IISL Nifty 100&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Analyst Rating: Silver&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Star Rating: 2 stars&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fund Manager: Prashant Jain&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Date of Analysis: June 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Equity Holdings (May 2020): 44&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Top 6 holdings (May 2020): ICICI Bank, L&#38;T, SBI, ITC, Infosys, RIL&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prashant isnt benchmark-conscious while constructing the portfolio. However, when he fails to uncover enough stocks that can generate alpha or believes that valuations are stretched, he doesnt shy away from aligning the portfolio with index. But that is not to suggest that he is a closet indexer. The portfolios top picks, such as ICICI Bank and SBI, are significantly overweight versus the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Global oil demand, CO2 emissions likely peaked in 2019: energy consultancy</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-oil-demand/global-oil-demand-co2-emissions-likely-peaked-in-2019-energy-consultancy-idINL8N2E25LV</link>
            <description> OSLO (Reuters) - Global oil demand and carbon dioxide emissions probably peaked in 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on both, energy consultancy DNV GL said on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62; FILE PHOTO: A seagull flies in front of an oil platform in the Bouri Oilfield some 70 nautical miles north of the coast of Libya, October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi/File Photo&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Norway-based consultancy, which advises both petroleum and renewable energy companies on risk management and technology, said global energy use would be 8% lower in 2050 than previously expected due to the impact of the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Lasting behavioural changes to travel, commuting and working habits will also decrease energy usage and lessen demand for fossil fuels from the transport sector as well as from iron and steel production, DNV GL said in a statement about its research on the impact of the pandemic on oil demand and emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While we expect oil demand to recover next year, we think that it's likely that it will never reach the levels seen in 2019, Sverre Alvik, head of DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook, told Reuters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The International Energy Agency said on June 16, it did not expect oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 due to a slump in air travel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; DNV GL has previously predicted oil demand would plateau in 2022.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Growing scepticism about long-term global oil demand in a post-pandemic world is putting pressure on oil companies to revalue their assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Shell ( ) said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the outlook for energy prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Renewable energy is seen benefiting from the crisis, because when total energy demand falls, the cheapest sources, such as wind and solar, are preferred to fossil fuels, Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; While global CO2 emissions also likely peaked in 2019, the expected decline in future would not be steep enough to meet the Paris climate agreement goals, so other measures such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater use of hydrogen were needed, DNV GL said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; COVID-19 has shown that behavioural changes are indeed possible, and we can use this opportunity to make a change which is good for (the) climate, Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Susan Fenton&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Three SECI Solar Tenders Get Yet Another Bidding Extension</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/three-seci-solar-tenders-get-extension/</link>
            <description> The solar projects are to be located in Telangana, Leh, and Kargil&#60;p&#62;The Solar Energy Corporation of India ( SECI ) has extended the bid submission deadline for three of its recent solar tenders that have already seen several extensions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The deadlines have been extended for the 32 MW (AC) overburden dump-based solar power projects and 15 MW (AC) floating solar power projects to be developed at the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), located in Telangana. SCCL is jointly owned by the Telangana government and the central government.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the latest announcement, the bid submission deadline for the 32 MW projects has been extended to July 09, 2020, and the new deadline for the 15 MW (AC) floating solar projects has been set as July 10, 2020. The existing deadline for bid submission 32 MW projects was June 29, 2020. Similarly, the existing deadline for the 15 MW floating solar projects was July 01, 2020. SECI had already extended the deadlines to these two projects twice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In March 2020, SECI had invited bids for these 32 MW solar projects at SCCL. The projects are to be developed at two different sites, with 22 MW to be set at SCCLs Ramagundam site and 10 MW at the Dorli site.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Then in April this year, another tender was floated for the development of 15 MW floating solar projects in Telangana. The projects are to be developed at two different sites- a 10 MW project at the Singareni thermal plants storage reservoir, and a 5 MW project at the Dorli siteon the SCCL premises.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, SECI has once again extended the bid submission deadline for a tender that includes 14 MW of solar power projects with 42 MWh battery storage system (7MW/21 MWh each) at Leh and Kargil.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As per the latest announcement, the bid submission deadline has been extended to July 30, 2020. The existing deadline for the submission of bids was June 30, 2020. Earlier, SECI had extended the deadline to June 30, 2020, from June 01, 2020. Before that as well, it had extended the bid submission deadline to June 01, 2020, from April 16, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In February, SECI had floated a tender for the setting up of 14 MW of solar power projects with 42 MWh battery storage system at Leh and Kargil divisions under the Prime Minister Development Package 2015.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the tender document, the land for the setting up the solar projects with battery storage will be facilitated and made available to the developer by the Ladakh Renewable Energy Development Agency ( LREDA ) and Kargil Renewable Energy Development Agency ( KREDA ) separately. The LREDA and KREDA will also provide the required land for the establishment of a substation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Adani Green to Get Refund of 1.2 Million for Another 20 MW Solar Project in Karnataka</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/adani-green-refund-another-solar-karnataka/</link>
            <description> The penalty was levied for a delay in land acquisition for the project&#60;p&#62;The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission ( KERC ) has issued an order directing the Mangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (MESCOM) to refund a penalty of 1.2 million (~$15,950) to Adani Green Energy Limited ( AGEL ).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The penalty was levied on AGEL by MESCOM for not producing the documentary evidence for land possession for setting up a 20 MW solar project in Malur taluk of Kolar district in the state. The company had filed a petition stating that it could not perform its obligations under the power purchase agreement (PPA) because of force majeure events.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On February 12, 2016, Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) had issued a Request for Proposal (RfP) for 290 MW of solar projects to be implemented in 17 taluks in Karnataka. AGEL won 20 MW of solar projects in the auction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Following this, AGEL and MESCOM entered into a PPA on June 29, 2016, and the Commission approved this on October 19, 2020. AGEL was expected to commission the project within 12 months. The PPA had also specified certain conditions to be fulfilled by the company within eight months. The parties executed a supplemental PPA on December 26, 2016.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;AGEL, however, could not meet the deadline for furnishing documents showing the clear title and the possession of the land required for the project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subsequently, MESCOM said that since AGEL had not fulfilled the conditions within the specified eight months, damages worth 1.2 million (~$15,950) would be levied as per the terms of the PPA.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To this, AGEL responded, stating that the reasons for the delay amounted to force majeure events and stated that the MESCOM was not entitled to impose a penalty.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company explained that documents were delayed because of delays in getting tentative evacuation authorization and approval under the Karnataka Land Reforms (KLR) Amendment Act, 2015.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In its analysis, the Commission noted that for establishing a solar power project, land should be available, and there should be an adequate facility for evacuating the power from the project to the nearest substation. The developer has to look for suitable land and confirm its availability before applying for evacuation approval. Therefore, AGELs contention that it had to search for the land-only after obtaining the evacuation approval cannot be accepted.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the Commission also noted that a 20 MW project needs about 100 acres of land and that the petitioner had identified about 107.45 acres of land at the time of filing of the application. It declared that since this was enough for the project, Adani Green was not entitled to pay any damages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In its order, the Commission asked MESCOM to refund 1.2 million (~$15,950) to AGEL within eight weeks from the date of its order. In the case the payment is not made, they will be penalized at a rate of 8% per year until the date of payment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Recently, in a similar order, the KERC passed a similar order saying that AGEL should get a refund of 1.2 million (~$15,950) from the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited, which was levied for a delay in submitting documentary evidence for a 20 MW solar project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In another petition filed for a similar project in Hassan district, the KERC had dismissed AGELs request to approve the date on which the supplemental power purchase agreement was signed to be the effective date of the PPA.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Mercoms India Solar Project Tracker, Karnataka has an installed large-scale solar capacity of over 7.3 GW, making it the leading solar state of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Solar Renewable Energy Certificates Trading Spikes in June</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/solar-recs-trading-spikes-june/</link>
            <description> The CERC recently revised forbearance and floor prices for solar and non-solar RECs&#60;p&#62;There was a surge in the trading of solar renewable energy certificates (RECs) in June 2020 compared to the previous month despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent lockdown across the country. However, the trading of non-solar RECs saw a slight decline in numbers when compared to May 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A total of 89,498 solar RECs were traded on both the exchanges, out of which 66,815 solar RECs were traded on the Indian Energy Exchange ( IEX ), and 22,683 solar RECs were traded on the Power Exchange India Limited ( PXIL ).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In comparison, there was a 116% rise in solar REC trading in June when compared to trade volumes in May. In May, a total of 41,469 solar RECs were traded, out of which 35,793 solar RECs were traded on the IEX, and 5,676 solar RECs were traded on the PXIL.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Solar REC trading registered an 87% growth on the IEX when compared to May, and on the PXIL, the trade volume recorded a phenomenal growth of 300% compared to the preceding month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the IEX, the price discovered for solar RECs saw a decline of 50% and came down to 1,000 (~$13.26)/REC from 2,000 (~$26.5)/REC in May. The price discovered for solar RECs on the PXIL saw a decline of 44% and stood at 1,010 (~13.3)/REC as compared to 1,800 (~$23.8)/REC in the previous month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Last week, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ( CERC ) issued an order implementing revised forbearance and floor prices for solar and non-solar RECs. In its order, the Commission implemented a forbearance (maximum) price of 1,000 (~$13) for solar and non-solar RECs for 2020, down from 2017s prices of 2,400 (~$31.6)/MWh and 3,000 (~$39.5) respectively. It also issued a floor price of zero for both solar and non-solar RECs from 1,000 (~$13)/REC previously. Until March 31, 2017, the floor price for solar RECs was 3,500 (~$46)/MWh. The CERC had proposed this revision in April, stating that the market for RECs has matured and that there was no longer a need for floor prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the IEX, the sale bid for solar RECs was 135,169, whereas the buy bid stood at 66,815. Similarly, on PXIL, the buy bid of solar RECs was 26,012, and the sale bid was 38,692.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking to Mercom, Shruti Bhatia, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR at IEX, said, The REC market has historically been experiencing a very similar trend to what we are seeing now on the exchange. Due to the annual renewable purchase obligation (RPO) compliance culture, the larger entities like captive power plants (CPPs) and DISCOMs tend to buy RECs to fulfil their RPO compliance only towards the end of the financial year. With the recent order by the CERC correcting the REC floor and ceiling prices, the REC market buy might start to pick up and we can expect a more balanced out buy momentum throughout the year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The trade volume of non-solar RECs dropped marginally to 11% when compared to the month of May. A total volume of 259,558 non-solar RECs was traded in June as compared to 292,301 recorded in May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Out of the total trade volume of 259,558 non-solar RECs, 162,873 were traded on the IEX, which marked a drop of 33%. A total of 96,685 non-solar RECs were traded on the PXIL, an increase of 95%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On both IEX and PXIL, the price discovered for non-solar RECs remained the same at 1,000 (~$13.26)/REC when compared to May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the IEX, the sale bid for non-solar RECs was 713,238, whereas the buy bid was 162,873. Similarly, on PXIL, the sale bid for non-solar RECs stood at 410,653, and the buy bid was 96,685.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier, CERC had passed an order extending the validity of RECs to avoid demand-supply imbalances in the REC market. It extended the validity of RECs that expired on April 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Additionally, it extended the validity of RECs set to expire between April 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, so that they remain valid until October 31, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

It was reported that the win, which was considered as the largest in the world in a single bid, would entail a total investment of approximately $6 billion (452 billion).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Mercoms India Solar Project Tracker, AGEL has an installed solar PV capacity of nearly 2.4 GW and 10 GW of solar PV projects under various stages of development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Last year, the company announced that its subsidiaries, Adani Renewable Energy Limited, Wardha Solar (Maharashtra), and Kodangal Solar Parks Private Limited, approved the issuance of dollar-denominated 20-year senior secured green bonds amounting to $362.5 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In May 2020, Adani Green had announced that its revenue rose 24% to 25.49 billion (~$339.8 million) in the financial year 2020, with revenue from power generation alone contributing 20.65 billion (~$275.3 million), thanks to the new projects being commissioned. The Gujarat-based solar and wind power developer said it sold 4,373 million units of power during the year, a 13% increase from last year, with newly commissioned projects, and the full period operationalization impact.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier, AGEL announced that it entered into a joint venture with TOTAL Solar Singapore PTE Limited for about 2.1 GW of operating solar power projects presently owned by Adani.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>GM must repay $60 million in state tax credits, Ohio AG says</title>

            <description> Yost cited a 2019 study that GM's Lordstown closure resulted in the loss of nearly 8,000 jobs and more than $8 billion in local economic activity, while the local school district had relied on the plant for 10% of its budget.&#60;p&#62; GM said Tuesday it "has demonstrated its commitment to Ohio through our investments of more than $3.3 billion in Ohio since 2009 ... We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the state."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As recently as 2016, GM employed 4,500 people at Lordstown and cut the final 1,500 jobs when production of the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze ended.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; GM sold the plant to an electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors that hopes to begin production next year with a few hundred workers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; GM and LG Chem are investing $2.2 billion to build a battery cell manufacturing plant in Lordstown that will create 1,100 jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ohio Governor Mike DeWine told reporters last week the state does not "necessarily have to get that cash back but what we do want to see is things that promote jobs in Ohio ... We're not actively pursuing a clawback."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also Read:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; U.S. appeals court stays order requiring GM, FCA meet to resolve GM lawsuit&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>VW ID.3 R Coming To Market In 2024: Report</title>
            <link>https://technocodex.com/vw-id-3-r-coming-to-market-in-2024-report/</link>
            <description> Volkswagen isnt letting its offensive towards electric cars be without a version catered towards those who want to drive fast. As early as September of last year, reports of an ID.3 R have already scratched the surface, which means that there is hope for a range-topping high-performance version of the ID.3 electric hatchback.&#60;p&#62;And VW has proven that it can indeed make a fast electric car through the record-setting attempts of the ID.R race car. As you would expect, the ID.3 R is meant to bridge the gap between the all-electric race car and its passenger-hauling counterparts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If youre wondering whether the ID.3 R will ever come to fruition, a report from Autocar said the VW bosses are about to sign off the plans for the electric hot hatch. More importantly, Autocars sources said that it will debut in 2024.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While this isnt a solid confirmation of the ID.3 Rs arrival, it still is a development from last year when a performance electric car was only a pipe dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nothing is set in stone at this point when it comes to the ID.3 Rs specifics. Autocar speculates that it will carry at least 300 horsepower (224 kilowatts), which is a major improvement than the ID.3s 204 hp (150 kW) and 229 pound-feet (310 Newton-meters) at launch.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Another thing that you can expect  or not expect  in the upcoming ID.3 R is the GTX badging. While those three letters are reserved for high-performance versions of the ID range, VW also keeps it at bay for ID vehicles with two motors and all-wheel drivetrain layout, which befit the U.S.-bound ID.4.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;An all-wheel-drive ID.3 is possible, according to Volkswagen development chief Frank Welsch in an interview with Autocar. However, this option will not be present for the hatchback in its first-generation model.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the latest news and updates, follow us on Google News.

            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111641-lt-builds-cryostat-for-usd-20-bn-global-fusion-proj</link>
            <description> Engineering and construction giant Larsen &#38; Toubro on Tuesday said it has achieved a major milestone under 'Make in India'initiative by building a cryostat for USD 20 billion global fusion project.&#60;p&#62;The final assembly or top lid sectors of the cryostat, a key part of the world's largest nuclear fusion reactor being built in France, were dispatched on Tuesday from the company's Hazira manufacturing complex in Surat district in Gujarat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) in 2012 chosen by ITER-India to manufacture and install cryostat - a vacuum pressure vessel made of 3,850 tonnes of stainless steel. L&#38;T Group Chairman AM Naik termed it a "moment of pride for India and Larsen &#38; Toubro".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The heavy engineering arm of L&#38;T, Indias leading engineering, construction, technology, manufacturing and financial services conglomerate, has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world."This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India initiative,"the company said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly weighing 650 tonne is to be installed with other cryostat segments for&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in a reactor pit in southern France. L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat. The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A virtual flag-off ceremony of the final assembly was held at the company's Hazira manufacturing complex. Dr Bernard Bigot, Director-General, ITER Global, KN Vyas, Chairman Atomic Energy Commission, India, UK Baruah, Project Director, ITER-India, V K Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog, A M Naik, Group Chairman L&#38;T and SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T, joined the ceremony virtually.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Naik said: "It is a moment of pride for India and for L&#38;T in particular -- as we have gathered to flag-off the last section of the Cryostat Vessel for the most ambitious clean energy project limitless carbon free energy that will power the future. L&#38;T has always been proud of this global collaborative research to build a greener planet." Subrahmanyan the company has used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-precision assemblies to ITER. "This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of largescale feasibility of fusion power. It has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology, Subrahmanyan added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Anil V Parab, Executive Vice President and Head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering told PTI that ITER is a USD 20 billion project and India is contributing 9 per cent of the project component. "With the supply of the Top Lid sector, we have successfully completed our India scope of the project ahead of the schedule. The fabrication of these components has been an engineering marvel both in terms of its massive size and its stringent quality standards. The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering is divided into three aspects, the company said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts Heavy Engineering business won this prestigious contract from ITER India, a wing of&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Department of Atomic Energy, for the ambitious mega scientific project, conducted in collaboration of seven elite countries, including India, and with a project outlay of around USD 20 billion..&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>REC Limited Disbursed 5.24 Billion in Loans to Renewable Energy Sector in FY2020</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/rec-limited-loans-renewable-energy/</link>
            <description> Outstanding loans from the renewable sector at the end of FY2020 stood increased at 160.78 billion&#60;p&#62;REC Limited has reported a 15.2% fall in its net profit during the financial year (FY) ending March 31, 2020, attributing it to market volatility as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;REC said that its net profit during the year fell to 48.86 billion (~$649.5 million) from 57.64 billion (~$766.17) in the previous year, citing a sharp depreciation in the Indian currency during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. It noted that its profits were down despite healthy operational performance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company, however, noted that its total income during the financial year was up 18% annually and stood at 298.55 billion (~$3.96 billion). It said that its loan book grew 15% over the year, with total loans standing at 3.220 trillion (~$42.8 billion) overall. It said that it had disbursed loans worth 756.67 billion (~$10.06 billion) during the year, a 4.8% increase from the year before.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the renewables front, the company posted that it had approved loans worth $70.26 billion (~$933.9 million), amounting to about 6% of all loans granted across sectors during the year. This was down from 118.75 billion (~1.58 billion), or 10% of total loans sanctioned in the previous year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During Q4 2020, REC said it approved 5.24 billion (~$69.6 million) in loans to renewables accounting to 4% of the total loans extended during the quarter. This was down from 15.87 billion (~$210.9 million), or 7% of overall loans disbursed in Q4 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Elaborating on actual disbursement of loans, 56.99 billion (~$757.5 million), 7% of all disbursements were made for renewables during the year. Of this, 9.58 billion (~$127.3 million) was disbursed just during the quarter ending March 31, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Outstanding loans from the renewable energy sector at the end of FY 2020 stood at 160.78 billion (~$2.14 billion), accounting for 5% of overall outstanding loans. This was up from 129.95 billion (~$1.73 billion) in the previous year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, and Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited were the top three borrowers, REC added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also said it had raised funds to the tune of 200 billion (~$2.66 billion) after March 31, 2020, from domestic and international markets. The company said that this included $500 million (~$37.62 billion) in U.S. dollar bonds and that REC was the first Indian company to raise funds through bonds during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;REC explained that its strong information technology capabilities and the availability of various applications online helped the company continue business operations without any disruptions resulting from the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It said that the companys decision to allow its customers to opt-in for the moratorium made available between March 31, 2020, and May 31, 2020, has helped it recover more than 78% of its total recoverable dues of 95 billion (~$1.26 billion) due for March 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Considering the companys liquidity position and access to diverse sources of funds, we have been able to steer through the challenging times without any pressures. The situation has been under close watch by the management to take prompt actions in the best interest of the company and the stakeholders in an optimized manner, said Sanjeev Kumar Gupta, Chairman &#38; Managing Director and Director (Technical) at REC Limited.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Several government announcements as COVID-19 relief measures will further improve liquidity position for NBFCs (non-banking financial institutions) and pave the way for power sector reforms, Gupta added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;REC Limited recently announced an opportunity for the distribution companies to avail loans to clear their dues. The loans under this program will be co-funded by REC and Power Finance Corporation (PFC) in equal amounts. As per the announcement, 50% of the loan will be provided in Tranche-I, and the rest will be provided in Tranche-II.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This came on the heels of the governments economic stimulus package in which it announced that DISCOMs would receive 900 billion (~$12.03 billion) to help the Indian economy recover from the coronavirus crisis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>NITI Aayog Introduces New Program to Decarbonize Indias Transport System</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/niti-aayog-introduces-new-program/</link>
            <description> The five-year project will design a tailor-made transport emissions assessment framework for India&#60;p&#62;The National Institute of Transforming India ( NITI ) Aayog and the International Transport Forum (ITF) of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ), have jointly launched a project aimed at decarbonizing Indias transport sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The program, Decarbonizing Transport in Emerging Economies (DTEE), is a collaboration between the ITF and the Wuppertal Institute, supported by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The launch took place through a webinar and was inaugurated by ITF Secretary-General Young Tae Kim and Amitabh Kant, the CEO at NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to a press statement issued by the Press Information Bureau, the Decarbonizing Transport in India, a five-year project, will help India develop a pathway towards a low-carbon transport system through new modeling tools and policy scenarios.The project will design a tailor-made transport emissions assessment framework for India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It will provide the government with a detailed understanding of current and future transport activity and the related carbon emissions as a basis for their decision-making, the release noted.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Kim said, This is a very important and promising undertaking that will provide practical support for the Indian government for making the right choices on the way to a low-CO2 transport system. Our collaboration on the Decarbonizing Transport in India project is also an opportunity to further strengthen the relationship between India and the ITF.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The transport sector in India is the third most greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting sector, where the major contribution comes from road transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the governments statement, out of the total carbon dioxide emissions in India, 13% come from the transport sector. These emissions have more than tripled since 1990. The increasing motorization and demand for mobility in India have contributed to air pollution, congestion, as well as the increase of greenhouse gas emissions in the urban area.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is part of the Decarbonizing Transport in Emerging Economies family of projects, which supports transport decarbonization across different world regions. India, Argentina, Azerbaijan, and Morocco are the current participants, the release noted.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, Kant said, Decarbonization of the transport sector would create a cleaner, healthier and more affordable future for everyone. The DTEE project would help India translate its climate ambitions into actions. The modeling tool and assessment framework would provide targeted analytical assistance to identify these climate actions and help us draw policies rooted in data analysis and advanced modeling.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Further, he said that the project could very well define the countrys future urban policies and could help in designing policies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The release noted that in India, carbon dioxide emitted per inhabitant was just about a twentieth of that of an average OECD country, yet, Indias transport carbon dioxide emissions are likely to increase by almost 6% annually by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;D.S. Mishra, secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, said, Our strategies need to be in tune with our requirements when our population doubles, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;NITI Aayog has been promoting electric vehicles and sustainable mobility to address the deteriorating air quality in the country and gear all states towards a sustainable future.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Air pollution is ranked fifth among the highest global risk factors for death. Breathing polluted air increases a persons chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections, and cancer.Air pollution is estimated to have caused nearly 4.9 million deaths in 2017, with India and China accounting for 1.2 million each, which was the highest in the world, Mercom reported previously.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June 2019, Mercom had reported that NITI Aayog had proposed that after 2030, electric vehicles are likely to be exclusively sold in the country. The 100% EV adoption by 2030 and increase in energy efficiency is aimed at reducing the countrys oil dependence while curbing air pollution in the long run.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Recently,the Supreme Court asked the Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to appear before it to discuss the proposal of the gradual transition of fossil-fuel-based vehicles on the roads to electric vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Image credit: Pexels /&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MARKET COMMENTARY Benchmarks trade higher amid positive global cues</title>
            <link>http://www.citrusinteractive.in/News/OpenNewsContent.aspx?SecId=4&#38;SubSecID=41&#38;NewsID=786876</link>
            <description> Indian equity benchmarks made slightly positive start on Wednesday taking lead from global peers. Soon, markets gained ground and are trading higher with notable gains in early deals. Buying in Energy, IT and TECK stocks aided the sentiments. Some support came in as the data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed that India's current account balance recorded a marginal surplus in the January-March quarter of FY20. Traders took note of the Reserve Bank of Indias data showing that direct investment into the country rose by $19 billion during 2019-20. Investors are eyeing the manufacturing PMI for June which is slated to be released later in the day. Though, weak economic data coupled with rising coronavirus cases in the country kept upside in check. India has yet again recorded more than 18,000 cases, taking its total number of coronavirus cases to 585,792. The government data showed that output of the 8 core sectors of the economy shrank by 23.4% in May. The government has reported that the fiscal deficit for the period of April-May, 2020 stands at Rs 4.66 lakh crore which is 58.6% of the Rs 7.96 lakh crore total budget aim. Besides, the revenue outlook remains to be weak with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection continuing its downtrend. The GST collection during the period April 1-June 25 stood as low as Rs 1,56,846 crore.&#60;p&#62;On the global front, most of the Asian markets are trading higher after Wall Street capped off one of its best quarterly performances in decades and as data showed that the manufacturing sector in China expanded at a faster rate in June. The latest survey from Caixin showed that the manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in June, and at a faster rate, with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.2. That's up from 50.7 in May and it moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong stock market is closed for a public holiday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Back home, auto stocks are buzzing as automobile firms release their June sales figures. Banking stocks are in limelight as S&#38;P Global Ratings said the coronavirus pandemic may push back the recovery of India's banking sector by years, which could hit credit flows and, ultimately, the economy. In scrip specific developments, ONGC fell after posting its first-ever quarterly loss on the back of an impairment loss. Vodafone Idea declined as it posted a loss of Rs 11,643.5 crore for the fiscal fourth quarter. Eveready Industries advanced ahead of its earnings release.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The BSE Sensex is currently trading at 35054.26, up by 138.46 points or 0.40% after trading in a range of 34927.20 and 35132.28. There were 19 stocks advancing against 11 stocks declining on the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The broader indices were trading mixed; the BSE Mid cap index fell 0.21%, while Small cap index was up by 0.09%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Energy up by 0.68%, IT up by 0.49%, TECK up by 0.45%, Telecom up by 0.38%, Bankex up by 0.22%, while Power down by 1.45%, Capital Goods down by 1.41%, Utilities down by 0.93%, Healthcare down by 0.73%, Industrials down by 0.71% were the top losing indices on BSE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gainers on the Sensex were Axis Bank up by 1.80%, ITC up by 1.75%, HDFC up by 1.59%, Indusind Bank up by 1.38% and SBI up by 1.09%. On the flip side, NTPC down by 3.03%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.86%, Larsen &#38; Toubro down by 2.45%, Tata Steel down by 1.50% and ONGC down by 1.47% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, S&#38;P Global Ratings in its latest report has said that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic may set back the recovery of India's banking sector by years, which could hit credit flows and, ultimately, the economy. It also expects non-performing loans in Indian banks will hit a fresh high, raising credit costs, and putting pressure on ratings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The US-based rating agency said in our base case, we expect the non-performing loans to shoot up to 1314 percent of total loans in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, compared with an estimated 8.5 percent in the previous fiscal year. Moreover, it said the resolution of these bad debt situations will likely unfold slowly, which means banks may also be saddled with a huge stock of bad loans next year. It added that an improvement of only about 100 basis points is expected in non-performing loans in fiscal year 2022 and the effect on finance companies will be more pronounced than on banks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;S&#38;P further stated that some finance companies lend to weaker customers and have high reliance on wholesale funding and these companies were already facing a trust deficit since the 2018 default of Infrastructure Leasing &#38; Financial Services. It said finance companies also face accentuated liquidity risks due to high proportion of borrowers opting for loan moratorium. It pointed out that after years of deterioration, asset quality in the Indian banking system had improved over the past 18 months, helped by higher write-offs, slower accretion of bad loans, and resolution of some big cases under the new bankruptcy law.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The CNX Nifty is currently trading at 10328.55, up by 26.45 points or 0.26% after trading in a range of 10299.60 and 10355.85. There were 27 stocks advancing against 23 stocks declining on the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gainers on Nifty were UPL up by 2.54%, Axis Bank up by 1.81%, ITC up by 1.72%, HDFC up by 1.61% and Eicher Motors up by 1.39%. On the flip side, NTPC down by 3.03%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.93%, Larsen &#38; Toubro down by 2.47%, Britannia Industries down by 1.66% and Bharti Infratel down by 1.65% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All the Asian markets are trading in green; Straits Times jumped 20.84 points or 0.80% to 2,610.75, Taiwan Weighted increased 105.86 points or 0.91% to 11,727.10, KOSPI rose 17.93 points or 0.85% to 2,126.26, Shanghai Composite advanced 27.10 points or 0.91% to 3,011.77. On the other hand, Nikkei 225 slipped 50.01 points or 0.22% to 22,238.13 and Jakarta Composite was down by 6.06 points or 0.12% to 4,899.33.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Overnight the Dow Jones ended the day with gains, however, Dow Futures were pointing lower for openings on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62;The Nifty was trading with gains of 2 points, at 10,304 points. Banking stocks like ICICI Bank and State Bank of India were seeing some early gains in trade.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Oil &#38; Natural Gas Corporation saw its shares drop by more than 2 per cent after the company posted a net loss of Rs 3,098.26 crore for the quarter ended March due to an exceptional item towards impairment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among the early gainers in trade from the Nifty were UPCL, BPCL and Bharti Airtel.

            <description> The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy on Tuesday.&#60;p&#62;VIJAYAWADA: The State government has decided to install four lakh more LED streetlights, in addition to the existing 25 lakh, in 2,000 rural habitations across various districts that were not covered under the initiative, named Jagananna Palle Velugu. The officials have also decided to entrust the responsibility of Complaint Monitoring System (CMS) of the streetlights to village secretariats as 80 per cent of the public representatives expressed dissatisfaction over the repair and maintenance of the lights.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy on Tuesday. According to a statement, the department officials said that 90 per cent of public representatives responded positively to the illumination quality of LED streetlights installed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), but 80 per cent of public representatives were not satisfied with the existing repairs and maintenance. In view of this, the government has decided to improve the Complaint Monitoring System of LED streetlights with an objective to bring down complaints.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Accordingly, 7,000 energy assistants (junior linemen) from village secretariats and 2.6 lakh village volunteers will be roped in, in coordination with AP State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation (APSEEDCO) and discoms, to improve the grievance redressal. Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said that the government was aiming at illuminating every village in the State under the LED streetlight programme.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>H1 2020 review: 3 stocks in BSE500 index double wealth, 17 rise over 50%</title>
            <link>https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/h1-2020-review-3-stocks-in-bse500-index-double-wealth-17-rise-over-50-5475971.html</link>
            <description> In the first half of 2020, only 121 stocks from the S&#38;P BSE 500 index delivered positive returns&#60;p&#62;Given a choice, most investors would want to skip the year 2020 from their portfolio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Both Sensex and Nifty50 are down by about 15 percent each so far in the year 2020. Meanwhile, S&#38;P BSE Midcap index fell 11 percent and S&#38;P BSE Smallcap index declined nearly 8 percent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Close&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Broader market has outperformed benchmark indices so far this year. The last six months have been a roller coaster ride for the markets. From record high in January to fall aroundUnion Budgetin Feb, and then bear market in Feb-March triggered by COVID-19 outbreak across the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although both Sensex and Nifty have rallied more than 30 percent each from their March lows, thanks to global liquidity, but a bulls market is still far away, caution experts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the first half of 2020, only 121 stocks from the S&#38;P BSE 500 index delivered positive returns. Among them, three stocks - Adani Green Energy, Suzlon Energy and GMM Pfaudler - rose more than 100 percent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The rally in GMM Pfadler and Adani Green is somewhat linked to the fundamentals, but the rally in Suzlon Energy is not justified considering its financial position, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking told Moneycontrol.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;GMM Pfadler is the market leader in glass-lined equipment. It is anticipated to benefit from the shifting of chemical manufacturing from China to India, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bagadia further added that apart from certain corporate action in the Adani Group, the rally in the Adani Green shares might be linked to it winning the worlds largest solar tender. Rally in Suzlon Energy might be in the anticipation of certain positivity in the renewable sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Out of 121 stocks, 17 rallied 50-100% in the first six months of 2020. These include Ajanta Pharma, Vaibhav Global, Dixon Technologies, Bayer CropScience, Granules India, The India Cement and Aurobindo Pharma.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Most of the stocks are from the small &#38; midcap space which have rallied over 50 percent in the first six months of 2020. The sheer outperformance in these stocks is largely attributed to the catch-up rally in the broader market space, and stock-specific fundamental factors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sheer underperformance and the oversold state of small and midcap stocks have resulted in outperformance when the market, in general, bounced back from lower levels, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Cash market stocks in mid and small-cap space have always outperformed the indices after a major correction in their prices. So this time is no different. The small and midcaps that made a top in 2018 followed by 2-3 years of major price cuts are now experiencing outperformance, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mehta further added that long-term investors should not get carried away by such outperformance and can have exposure to the extent of 20 percent in such small and midcap stocks with balance 80 percent in frontline large caps.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Index Performers:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stocks which Underperformed:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;More than 70 percent of the stocks in BSE500 gave negative returns in the last 6 months. And, 18 out of 376 stocks fell more than 50 percent that include names like IndusInd Bank, Future Retail, Repco Home, Lemon Tree, and Raymond.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although the market has bounced back from the lows recorded on March 24 we are still in a bear market rally. Economists at top global institutions see contractions of 4-5 percent in Indias GDP in 2020 due to lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The lockdown has not only impacted the economy but will lead to a big dent in earnings of India Inc. in the upcoming quarters. But, with news of reopening of economy, many stocks have seen a bounce back as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The markets peaked at the start of the year in January 2020 and we witnessed a vertical fall from the highs so we are witnessing a lot of stocks that gave negative returns but if one look at the broader picture these stocks have witnessed sharp up move also from their respective lows in March 2020, Rajeev Srivastava, Chief Business Officer at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We believe one should follow a sectoral approach and then drill down to individual stock wise research for better understanding. From the above-mentioned names stocks like IndusInd Bank, Repco Home looks good and one should buy in declines as they survived the mayhem, and once the economic recovery starts it would deliver strong earnings growth and returns over the coming years, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What should investors do?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The year 2020 started on a positive note and the bulls took the market to record high in the first month of January, but markets changed course post 20 of January when both Sensex and Nifty hit their respective lifetime highs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The first six months of 2020 was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride for investors where markets moved from a bull phase to a bear phase, and then again back in an intermediate bull phase.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The next months will be interesting for Indian markets but the upside is likely to remain capped. People are looking forward to the post COVID world which nobody can put a definitive timeline. But, stability would only come once we have a vaccine in place.The next months will bring plenty of opportunities for long term investors to get into stocks. The focus should be on stocks that are fundamentally strong, have strong dividend yield, and low leverage on books, suggest experts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Safety of portfolio and steady returns are one of the most important criteria for making an investment portfolio both for a new and existing player, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stocks that offer high dividend yields upwards of 6 percent and low debt with a good track record of 5 years can be a very good strategy to accumulate stocks irrespective of the 2nd wave, global trade wars, India-China disputes etc., he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mehta further added that such a composition of baskets will give above-average returns in 2-3yrs of time frame. In a falling interest rate scenario, getting dividend yields of 5-6 percent over a long period of time is certainly a great investment theme that may not come true every now and then, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            <description> Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy and sovereignty&#60;p&#62; July 01, 2020, 10:15 IST&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; CEO Amitabh Kant on Tuesday said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy and sovereignty, a day after the government banned 59 apps. Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty and transparency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "They must be transparent in origin &#38; final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Indians will leverage strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual control in Ladakh&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures," the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Follow and connect with us on Twitter Facebook Linkedin&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The utility and a plant building arm of the conglomerate have formed a venture that will use a virtual power plant (VPP) to pool some 600 megawatts (MW) of power from electrolysis units in Germany and Britain, they said&#60;p&#62;FRANKFURT: Germanys E.ON and Thyssenkrupp will make hydrogen available to the wholesale power market by pooling the output of 150 small electrolysis plants, the companies announced on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The utility and a plant building arm of the conglomerate have formed a venture that will use a virtual power plant (VPP) to pool some 600 megawatts (MW) of power from electrolysis units in Germany and Britain, they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The system has been tested at a 2 megawatt (MW) pilot plant in Duisburg and is ready to be for scaled up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With our expertise in all aspects of the energy market, we are also succeeding in breaking down a barrier to the useful application of hydrogen in generating electricity, Stefan Hakansson, E.ONs global director City Energy Solutions and head of E.ON Business Solutions, said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Germany and the European Union are pushing hydrogen as a clean fuel to meet climate targets via electrolysis in a process that passes electricity from wind and solar sources through water to extract carbon-free hydrogen.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The operating principle of E.ONs VPP is to shut down hydrogen output at the plants at times of high power demand, allowing green power to flow to consumers as now, and, conversely, to raise hydrogen production if there is surplus power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Electrolysis producers can thus market their flexibility to consumers via E.ONs online platform.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Germany recently dedicated 9 billion euros ($10.08 billion) for the build-up of hydrogen economies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Many schemes are starting up and brokers and exchanges are beginning to study possibilities of euro-denominated hydrogen contracts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But some banks say there is too much hype around hydrogen as major commercialisation is years away and the technology is still costly and unproven.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: reuters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Equity returns may be muted, says Balasubramanian of ABSL Mutual Fund</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/equity-returns-may-be-muted-says-balasubramanian-of-absl-mutual-fund/articleshow/76723061.cms</link>
            <description> , MD &#38; CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, for his perspective on the scenario. Bala, as he is widely known in the industry, asks investors to not give up and continue with their investments. If you have the bandwidth to continue your investments, then do not stop them or redeem in a market correction, he advises. For more, read the edited interview:&#60;p&#62; Mutual fund industry is facing a testing time. After a dream run of almost five years, investors are questioning their investment in mutual funds . The inflow/outflow numbers also underscore the trend. As an industry veteran, how do you view the scenario?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The world of investment goes through ups and downs in every 3-4 years cycle. The last one was in the year 2008. Post-Lehman crisis, a similar situation existed and in general investors' confidence was tested as the market remained volatile for a period of two years. However, that changed post 2014 and investor confidence came back. In fact, this time, we are seeing a spate of incidents, some unprecedented. We have seen financial market uncertainty starting from IL&#38;FS crisis, to a general slowdown in the Indian economy and subsequently the impact of COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; During such a period, investors have to stay patient keeping in mind the purpose of investment and tenure of investment. Steps that are being taken by policy makers, whether it is from the Government or RBI or other regulatory bodies do create the right impact on the economy and financial markets for its revival over time. In fact, many steps that have been taken in the last two years should play out gradually in time to reflect in our economy and thus in the market. Equity as an asset class holds huge potential to give returns above the cost of capital, but one has to give a long rope to witness such benefit, given the impact of macro and micro economy in the short term.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the debt side, there were noise levels around the credit category, but fund houses at large have managed liquidity well and met investor requirements. Debt markets continue to provide significant investment opportunities and there are various other categories in debt funds across duration that have continued to deliver and grow, reflecting both investor affinity and confidence. It will remain a segment that can cater to the needs of conservative investors with a reasonable investment time horizon, as well as an essential part of asset allocation needs of all investors by providing stable returns. But like any market instrument even this asset class can go through ups and downs, which is something that must be kept in mind for any investment instrument.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investment is a game of patience, and a tough one especially when market cycles take longer than anticipated to turn. But what is a given is the fact that every down trend will be followed by an eventual upswing. While markets will go through its motions, if one carries a long-term focus on wealth creation and concentrates on asset allocation without being influenced by either fear or greed, there is meaningful gain to be made from mutual funds. Staying on with conviction, linked to the purpose of any investment would aid the right decision making and experience.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has taken some extra steps to make its debt funds safer in the current scenario. Would you please explain the steps?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First and foremost, we all revisit the risk framework after any development in the marketplace that creates uncertainty in general for the economy and for the financial market. One such approach is the principle of S-L-R, which is nothing but Safety comes first, then comes Liquidity and then comes Return. However, it may not work every time as investors may also want to shift their focus from SLR to RLS. We have to strike the right balance in order to generate fair returns for investors and at the same time manage portfolio uncertainty through a disciplined approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have managed our suite of offerings, staying true to label and aligned strongly to their individual mandates of duration or credit risk. We have clearly defined the exposure that can be taken in various rated instruments. As a fund house with a 25-year legacy, we not only manage a large pool of assets in fixed income across different categories that have consistently grown and delivered above industry average return, we also manage the risk associated with both macro and micro very well through our team and with a structured approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have put in place binding conditions for portfolio exposure to single security or group in a manner that the overall portfolio diversification is maintained to reduce the risk. Maintaining safety and liquidity has always been the key focus. Our portfolios are centred on high quality AAA companies and public sector entities. In credit-oriented funds we have worked to put together a safety wall with a higher allocation of AAA and government bonds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The disruptions caused by the Covid pandemic point towards a bleak economic growth in the coming year. When do you see the economic growth getting back on track?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It appears the impact of Covid has taken the economy behind by one or two years. All companies are looking at new ways of driving business post Covid learnings. At the same time, government bodies and RBI have been working overtime to provide the right interest rate environment through monetary policy and fiscal measures to pump up the economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; So far, we have been successful in bringing down the interest rate and improving liquidity in the system. Credit spreads have been selectively coming down. Companies are given temporary moratorium and the real activity should begin once lock down gets relaxed across the country. Therefore, one should give 3 to 6 months for things to stabilise and look for growth to come back at the beginning of 2021. Given the large size of our economy, one can expect a V shaped recovery, supported by significant interest coming from global investors to India in the area of manufacturing and asset heavy businesses.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Should equity mutual fund investors temper their expectations on a quick revival of the stock market? Are the returns going to be muted this year?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Equity returns may be muted given the poor growth in Indian economy and consequent earnings disruption for India Inc. While one can argue that fundamentals of the economy does not support buoyant equity markets, flows into equity from both domestic and overseas could drive the sentiment and hence can generate decent returns. Having said that, one should not expect more than low teens return from equity this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Which are the best categories, sectors to ride such a challenging period?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; People across the world are adopting a lifestyle change to cope up and live with Covid 19, which has resulted in some correlated sectors and industries benefiting from this change and have performed well. It is commonly known that in different phases of the market, different sectors emerge as winners. Pharma, Telecom &#38; Auto were winners in the recent recovery period. We are also positive on the consumer goods segment, especially small ticket discretionary items and consumer staples.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; During this period, sectors like Energy and Cement provide great comfort from the earnings point of view and valuation. There are heavy asset driven companies that have been beaten down with earnings outlook not any better in the near term. Such companies have to be looked at from other parameters such as price to book or replacement value etc. There are many value companies that may tend to perform as these firms are never found in the portfolio for delivering high growth but for their cheap valuation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Given the market correction and the price at which some marquee names are available, investors can look at large cap funds. The multi-cap category which has the flexibility to invest across market caps is also a good pick.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the debt side there are opportunities across duration. Apart from making the smart move of keeping surplus money in liquid Funds, investors can look at funds with shorter maturities from 1-3 year horizon, so Corporate Bond funds, Banking &#38; PSU Debt Funds, Low Duration Fund, can be good categories to park money.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Many investors are looking at gold and international funds as a new opportunity to make money during troubled times. What is your advice? Gold and international funds can be good from a diversification purpose, but it cannot be the core of one's portfolio, especially for retail investors. It is advisable to look into any new investment opportunity from the point of view of one's financial goals and objectives and asset allocation strategy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What do you think should be the dos and don'ts for mutual fund investors at this point? Various asset classes behave differently at different points of time. Hence, asset allocation helps one to protect their investments and help the investor benefit from the performance cycles of the asset classes. Continue with your SIPs that are designed to take care of market swings and avoid getting influenced by short term noises, and tracking short term data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investors should spread their investments with what I call the WITS model and a solution-based approach that we follow to categorise our offerings: Wealth Solution (Equity Funds across market cap), Income Solutions (Fixed Income funds), Tax Solutions (ELSS) and Savings Solution (Liquid &#38; Overnight funds). Mutual funds offer a variety of solutions to suit one's goals and risk appetite. Maintain a good mix of actively-managed equity funds, debt funds, and index funds or ETFs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The current lockdown will change consumption patterns in the long run, investors must evaluate whether that leaves room to scale up investments. This is also a good opportunity for first time investors or those sitting on the fence to enter or increase equity positions and take advantage of the market correction. With markets down and low interest rates, coupled with RBI infused liquidity, identify the opportunities arising in the equity and fixed income space, ask an expert or your financial advisor.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just like it was advised that one should avoid taking a moratorium on term loans if one had the ability to pay, similarly, it is advisable that if you have the bandwidth to continue your investments, then do not stop them or redeem in a market correction. If one is really pressed for resources, an investor can avail other facilities that AMCs provide to pause the SIP instalment for a few months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This interview is part of a series of interviews we are conducting to address the concerns raised by our readers regarding the safety and stability of their investments in both equity and debt during these testing times.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Here are some previous interviews for your perusal:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Markets may remain volatile in near term, Nimesh Shah of ICICI Pru MF&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Time to increase allocation to mid/small cap funds, says Pankaj Tibrewal of Kotak Mutual Fund&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "New love for international funds is related to disappointment with Indian equities"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>WoodMac: Solar and Storage Prices Falling Faster Than Expected Due to COVID-19</title>
            <link>https://www.eqmagpro.com/woodmac-solar-and-storage-prices-falling-faster-than-expected-due-to-covid-19/</link>
            <description> Weakness in the global markets for solar modules and batteries is pushing down U.S. system costs more rapidly than forecast.&#60;p&#62;Project construction delays and tightening consumer spending will drive down storage and electric vehicle demand, according to Wood Mackenzie. This in turn will cause U.S. front-of-the-meter (FTM) storage system costs to decline more rapidly than previously forecast.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the same time, WoodMac finds, solar PV system costs in the U.S. are falling faster than anticipated across all market segments.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Declines in FTM solar system costs are primarily being driven by module price reductions, which are partly attributable to price pressure on manufacturers stemming from demand destruction caused by the coronavirus crisis. Similarly, battery price reductions are the key factor driving the broader system-price reductions WoodMac is expecting for FTM energy storage systems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Storage pricing impacts from the coronavirus pandemic&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stakeholders anticipate delays in FTM energy storage and solar projects for the U.S. in 2020. Global EV sales are also expected to drop by 43 percent year-over-year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Driven by the downside in battery demand from both storage and EV markets, system cost declines for FTM storage are going to reach 10 percent year-over-year in 2020, which is significantly more than the 7 percent year-over-year decline anticipated in Wood Mackenzies pre-coronavirus scenario.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: Wood Mackenzies U.S. Front-of-the-Meter Storage System Price Trends, H1 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the near term, there is a risk of battery oversupply, especially among Chinese vendors. Post-2022, the market will begin to rebound and is expected to return to normalcy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Beyond batteries, storage balance-of-system costs will see minimal impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the pandemic is contained and the global economy begins to recover, system costs will resume their previously forecasted pace of steady year-over-year declines.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the domain of solar, mono PERC utility system costs are now expected to decline 20 percent from 2020 to 2025, compared to the pre-pandemic forecast of a 16 percent price decline during that period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Module cost reductions will be the most significant factor impacting commercial and industrial and utility-scale system costs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Module manufacturers are not only facing reduced demand and subsequently lowering margins to stay competitive, but they are also experiencing a reduction in their supply-chain component costs, leading to module price declines at the end of Q1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The reduction of the federal Investment Tax Credit to 26 percent in 2020 will create further downward price pressure across all market segments, for both developers and engineering, procurement and construction providers. However, we dont expect significant changes to system costs, as these industry participants have been preparing for the stepdown for some time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As the solar industry faces demand destruction in 2020 resulting from the ongoing pandemic, the impact across market segments will vary. For the residential segment in particular, we expect demand to pick back up by the end of the year before the Investment Tax Credit steps down again in 2021.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a result, some companies may be able to maintain healthier project margins toward the end of 2020 as a result of the heightened demand, in a manner akin to the situation seen at the end of 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;**&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Molly Cox is a solar analyst and the author of the new Wood Mackenzie report U.S. Solar PV System Pricing, H1 2020.

            <title>Equity indices end flat after choppy trade, energy stocks lose</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111596-equity-indices-end-flat-after-choppy-trade-energy-stocks-lose</link>
            <description> Equity benchmark indices underwent bouts of volatility on Tuesday but ended flat despite strong global cues after data showed that China's manufacturing sector grew more than expected in June.&#60;p&#62;Investors said traders preferred to book profits and took shelter of safe-haven assets like gold and it is generally considered as a traditional hedge.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The fears of rapid coronavirus and its impact on global growth and rising geopolitical tensions between India-China, US-China and US-European Union has increased the demand for gold. Moreover, rise in crude oil prices and hike in gold ETFs holdings is providing support to the gold price," said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research for Currency at Emkay Global Financial Services. At the closing bell, the BSE S&#38;P Sensex was down by 46 points or 0.13 per cent at 34,916 while the Nifty 50 edged lower by 10 points or 0.1 per cent at 10,302.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sectoral indices at the National Stock Exchange were mixed with Nifty PSU losing by 1.7 per cent and pharma by 1.5 per cent. Among stocks, Bharat Petroleum Corporation was down by 2.5 per cent to close at Rs 373.75. Power Grid Corporation fell by 1.9 per cent, GAIL by 1.8 per cent, IndianOil Corporation by 1.7 per cent, Coal India by 1.2 per cent and ONGC by 1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sun Pharma, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel and UPL too closed in the negative terrain. However, auto stocks gained with Maruti Suzuki up by 2.6 per cent at Rs 5,830 per share, Hero MotoCorp by 1.8 per cent and Eicher Motors by 1.1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nestle India, Britannia, Tata Steel and HDFC traded with positive bias but with thin margins. Meanwhile, Asian shares rose after data in China showed activity quickening in its vast factory sector. That was a hopeful sign for the global economy struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hong Kong stocks were up by 0.5 per cent despite the Chinese parliament's passage of a security law that will increase Beijing's control over the former British colony. The Nikkei rose by 1.33 per cent while shrugging off a decline in Japanese industrial production and South Korean Kospi was up by 0.71 per cent. (ANI)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MoU signed between Indianoil, NTPC Ltd, and SDMC for Waste to Energy plant in Delhi</title>
            <link>https://udaipurkiran.com/mou-signed-between-indianoil-ntpc-ltd-and-sdmc-for-waste-to-energy-plant-in-delhi/</link>
            <description> A MoU was signed today on Waste to Energy plant at Okhla, Delhi, between Indian Oil, NTPC Ltd and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The&#60;p&#62;ceremony was witnessed by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &#38; Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Shri RK Singh, Minister of State (I/c) for Power and New &#38; Renewable Energy, and Shri Anil Baijal, Lt. Governor of Delhi. Secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Tarun Kapoor, Shri Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IndianOil, Senior officials from the Ministry of Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas, SDMC, NTPC Limited, and IndianOil were also present. Under the MoU, IndianOil, SDMC and NTPC shall come together to develop a demonstration Waste-to-energy Plant at Okhla landfill site in Delhi, using Gasification technology. This Plant shall process 17500 tons per annum of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) produced from combustible components of Municipal Waste to generate syngas which shall in turn be used to generate electricity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a major issue in Delhi, and this Energy plant will open the path towards the solution. He congratulated IndianOil, SDMC and NTPC for coming together for this landmark project that has the potential to carve out a greener and more energy efficient future for the Atmanirbhar Bharat as envisioned by the Honble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Pradhan said that there is an existing model of providing offtake guarantee, under the SATAT scheme for compressed biogas production plants. He said that the venture would succeed, as there are guarantees from two Maharatna companies. He called for quick expansion and replication of such pilot project in other places also. The Minister said that gas generation from waste will also help in cutting imports of petroleum products and saving precious foreign exchange. Shri Pradhan asked IOCL, NTPC to join hands with the Department of Science and Technology, to develop Hydrogen Fuel technology. India has large appetite for the energy, and development of Hydrogen technology can be done on the Commercial scale in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shri R.K.Singh said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi always talks about breaking silos and this is a good example of two ministries coming together, for a good public cause. The problem of Solid Municipal waste is rampant throughout the country, more so in Tier II and III cities. Large mounds of wastes are not only health hazards and environmental concerns, but also big eyesores. He said that the Ministry has taken a decision to support such plants, irrespective of the cost of the production of gas from them vis-&#195;&#160;-vis other means. He said that technology being used in the Delhi plant, will not only result in less emission, but also provide usable residues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shri Anil Baijal said that solid waste management is a big challenge in the national capital. On the one hand, there is a legacy of big mounds of waste accumulated over several decades, while on the other hand, there is not enough space for the current waste. The city has the capacity to process only half of its waste. The commissioning of such plants will not only provide a clean and environment-friendly way to handle solid wastes, but also generate gas and manure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> As per the data available with the government, over 65 per cent students enrolled with government schools have no access to the online classes in Jharkhand.&#60;p&#62;Only 35% children have access to online classes&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As per the data available with the government, over 65 per cent students enrolled with government schools have no access to the online classes in Jharkhand. According to official, only 33 per cent of 42 lakh students are connected through WhatsApp for online classes in the state while rest of the 67 per cent students are still deprived of it as they do have access to smart phones. To facilitate educational activities for students at their homes during lockdown, digital classes were started, which uses WhatsApp as a platform for imparting lessons to students online during the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CCL contributes `20 crore to fight Covid-19&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, making its contribution to the State Disaster Management Authority to fight against Covid-19, handed over a cheque of `20 crore to Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren. In addition to that, more than `1.3 crore has been given to district administrations of all the 8 districts in CCL command areas under corporate social responsibility programme. Expressing gratitude at the social initiative taken by the coal company, Soren said that everyone has a responsibility towards the society and the need of the hour was to work in tandem among all government and voluntary institutions to fight against the infection. CCL is a Category-I Mini-Ratna Company since October 2007.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Magic collars to protect stray animals&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dogs and cattle stray animals are being tagged with reflective collars in Jamshedpur for avoiding road mishaps. Jharkhand Animal Welfare Society, in collaboration with Ranchi-based animal welfare organisation Mission Fast (Feed a Stray) and Pawsitivity of Indore has come up with this initiative. Society president Arun Kumar Jha said, with the increasing number of accidents with stray animals, they decided to come to the rescue of the stray animals. According to Jha, they wanted streets to be safer for the four-legged ones as the rate of accidents is high during hours of poor visibility.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Home delivery of liquor to be discontinued&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jharkhand, which was the first state to introduce home delivery of liquor through Zomato and Swiggy, is likely to discontinue the facility as it is not getting much response. Officials in Excise department informed that consumption of liquor still being a taboo in Indian society and the people are reluctant to place on-line orders in front of their family members and prefer to get it directly from the retail wine shops. Notably, to avoid unwanted crowding at liquor shops, Jharkhand government has roped in food start-ups like Swiggy and Zomato to deliver liquor at peoples doorsteps in some big cities like Ranchi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mukesh Ranjan&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our correspondent in Jharkhand mukesh.r@newindianexpress.com&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>ONGCs March quarter results keep the energy low for the stock</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ongc-s-march-quarter-results-keep-the-energy-low-for-the-stock-11593579363666.html</link>
            <description> Revenues at  21456 crore, representing 20% year-on-year decline, were slightly ahead of Street estimates but net crude oil price realisations declined by almost 21% to $49.01 a barrel&#60;p&#62;Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) share has so far fallen about 38% from its highs in January. As it turns out, the companys March quarter results announced on Wednesday evening dont inspire much confidence. True, revenues at&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 21456 crore, representing 20% year-on-year decline, were slightly ahead of Street estimates but net crude oil price realisations declined by almost 21% to $49.01 a barrel. Oil and gas volumes fell by 7.3% and 10.6%, respectively.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Profitability picture was dull though. An increase of 11% in other expenses weighed on profits, especially when other components of operating costs have declined. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) declined by 30.6% to 8,588 crore. Further, other income declined sharply and there was also an impairment loss of about 4,900 crore. The upshot: ONGC reported a net loss of 3,098 crore for the March quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For the March quarter, the decline in gas production was sharper at about 9% compared to the 1.4% drop in crude oil production.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Thursday, ONGC shares were trading 1% lower in early deals when the Nifty 50 index was marginally up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After a disappointing ending to financial year 2020, prospects for ONGC stock are not any brighter. Remember, earlier this calendar year, covid-19 related concerns had led to a sharp drop in global crude oil prices. While oil prices have recovered from the lows, triggers for a meaningful jump in oil prices are few and far between. Higher oil prices are critical for ONGCs fortunes as they help improve realisations. As such, muted outlook on prices doesnt augur well for the company.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated its sell rating on the stock given expected sharp decline in domestic gas prices, recurring disappointment on volumes, elevated operating/ capex costs and policy apathy amid weak oil cycle. Our reverse valuation exercise suggests the stock is already discounting crude price recovering to about $48 per barrel,"wrote Kotak analysts in a report today.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

            <title>The Pandemic Made Me Love My Solar Panels</title>
            <link>https://www.eqmagpro.com/the-pandemic-made-me-love-my-solar-panels/</link>
            <description> During the coronavirus lockdown, the light at the end of the tunnel for my family was reflected from the rooftop of our old Austrian farmhouse.&#60;p&#62;For those six long weeks, a record run of clear, cool, and sun-soaked days helped us cope with the litany of dark news that upended global markets at the height of Covid-19. Working alongside our solar panels showed how an investment in renewable energy might yet make our home economics stronger on the other side of the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It wasnt clear wed invest in solar back when we bought the place. The 230-year-old stone cottage was originally designed as a bolthole for itinerant lumberjacks sent to harvest timber in Austrias Waldviertel, an hour northwest of Vienna. By the time we arrived in 2012, there were more immediate energy upgrades that made sense.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Panels tell more about the politics in the home than they do about its power, the owner gruffly told us before we passed papers. And for years we followed his advice to invest in making the house more energy-efficientreplacing windows with double-paned glass, insulating the attic, installing a heat pump and infrared electric panels to back up high-efficiency wood stoves. There wasnt a lot of money left over to put into glitzy photovoltaics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But a couple of important new facts changed our calculations over the years. One was our familys sensitivity, particularly that of my 15-year-old son, to the science of climate change. The other was that the economics of solar became much more attractive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During long walks in the surrounding woods, we discussed how a warmer planet changes the way that carbon cycles between the atmosphere, vegetation, and oceans. Our sons alarm over climate change grew over the years as he witnessed the effects of ever milder winters and drier summers on the local ecologywhich was already threatening to destroy our regions traditional timber industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even though Austria generates some 80% of its electricity with renewables, mostly hydropower, its become clearer that the country needs many more solar panels and windmills to reduce industrial emissions from aluminum, steel, and brick manufacturers. To meet its climate goals, the state-run utility, Verbund AG, figures Austria needs to install new clean sources equivalent to twice the volume of electricity currently generated by all the turbines churning on Austrias stretch of the Danube River.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And then there was the important issue of cost. Solar prices fell more than 75% in the eight years since we bought the house. The manufacturing cost to make commonly used panels generate a watt of power was 85&#194;&#162; in 2012, according to BloombergNEF. That figure fell to about 21&#194;&#162; by this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We finally took the plunge in 2018 after determining that investing in solar was a safe and responsible use of cash otherwise languishing in our zero-interest savings account. The lure of eventually supplying our own fuel for an electric car, which would dramatically shorten the payback timeline, also influenced our decision.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Austria subsidized our roughly 12,000 ($13,463) solar investment to the tune of about 1,500 at the end of 2018. We also bought a 5-kilowatt battery that stores the equivalent of one hour of sunshineenough to get us through a single night of cooking dinner and watching TV, with enough juice left over to brew coffee in the morning. The national electricity grid contracted to pay us a bit more than 5&#194;&#162; for each extra kilowatt-hour we produce but cant consume. It installed a digital meter that accounts for the power our home uses, and we sell the excess back to the grid.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the eve of March 12, when Covid-19 forced everyone in Austria to shelter at home, wed been producing and consuming solar energy for about a year, with mixed results. It took longer than it should have for the utility to process our paperwork, resulting in several months of wasted generation. Then there was the learning curve in figuring out the clunky apps that control the battery and panels. We figured we were on the long end of the 9- to 10-year investment payback on a system expected to operate at least two decades. At the end of the first year we still had to buy about 30% of our electricity from the grid, but we were able to offset that cost (and make a small profit) by generating 800 of power and selling the excess on sunny days.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>China to cut or suspend subsidy for substandard waste-to-energy power plants</title>
            <link>https://in.reuters.com/article/us-china-pollution-power/china-to-cut-or-suspend-subsidy-for-substandard-waste-to-energy-power-plants-idINKBN2424CD</link>
            <description> BEIJING (Reuters) - China will cut or suspend subsidy for waste-to-energy (WTE) power plants that violate emission standards, as part of its anti-pollution campaign, the country's finance and environment ministries said late on Tuesday.&#60;p&#62; The move, effective July 1, aims at improving environmental levels at WTE power plants and mitigating public discontent with stench and the risk of toxic emissions, such as dioxin.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) had rolled out a new regulation last year, forcing waste incinerators to reveal real-time emission and temperature data to the public as well as to upload it to the environmental bureau monitoring system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The government will cut or even suspend the subsidy for the WTE power generators that are found not revealing emission data or forging the data or not reaching the standards, according to the joint statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; China has vowed to build waste incineration handling capacity of 591,400 tonnes per day by 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At end 2019, China had installed WTE power generation capacity of 12.02 gigawatts (GW) and daily incineration capacity of 490,000 tonnes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to China's Biomass Energy Association, the country is expected to add 2.9 GW WTE power generation capacity in 2020, requiring a subsidy of about 11.1 billion yuan ($1.57 billion).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, Beijing has been striving to curtail financial supports to renewable power sources in order to ease a backlog of subsidy payment exceeding 223 billion yuan, which may shadow the development of WTE projects in the pipeline.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Reporting by Muyu Xu and David Stanway; Editing by Shailesh Kuber&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.eqmagpro.com/clean-energy-investment-can-support-countries-to-recover-better-seforall/</link>
            <description> Africa is a region full of promise and a growing economic powerhouse, yet this progress is stifled without access to sufficient, reliable and affordable energy.&#60;p&#62;As countries continue to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, a new guide by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) (SEforALL.org) shows how clean energy investment can support countries to Recover Better, and use this unique moment to reset their economies and close energy access gaps.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide for African Countries (bit.ly/2Bn7lGG) that was released by SEforALL today, countries that commit to an ambitious recover better strategy today can deliver long term economic growth, new jobs, and sustainable energy for all in the long-term.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is particularly key for Africa after COVID-19 has highlighted the deep regional divide on energy access progress. Africa is a region full of promise and a growing economic powerhouse, yet this progress is stifled without access to sufficient, reliable and affordable energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The latest data (bit.ly/2Af8cIS) on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7)  access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030  shows that progress in Africa is still off track to meet global targets. 565 million people still lack access to electricity, and a further 900 million lack clean cooking solutions. The pandemic risks setting progress even further behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;By acting on the enabling measures put forward in The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide, countries across Africa will benefit from increased GDP, affordable energy provision, and improved agriculture, gender and health outcomes. This re-set can also spark progress at the speed and scale needed to meet SDG7 and help put the global economy on a trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 has changed the world as we know it. As countries rebuild economies from the impact of the pandemic, they are faced with a unique, once in a generation opportunity to Recover Better with sustainable energy, said Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and Co-Chair of UN-Energy. There has never been a better time to invest in clean, efficient renewable energy. Countries that recover better with sustainable energy will see the pay off in the form of resilient economies, new jobs, and faster energy development. By making this investment, African countries can develop a competitive advantage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the launch of the guide, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, said: COVID-19 has presented a unique opportunity to accelerate the transition to that clean, affordable, reliable and renewable energy source offered by the sun. Nigeria is committed to the full utilization of this abundant solar energy source. The Federal Government has already removed fossil fuel subsidies and included 5 million solar connections in our post-COVID economic sustainability plan  first steps to new jobs and a cleaner, healthier environment. We commend Sustainable Energy for All for producing this practical Recover Better guide that will help African governments close the energy access gap and deliver economic growth for the benefit of our people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The global economy is increasingly being powered by clean and efficient sources of energy. According to research, the dollar for dollar investments in clean energy creates three times the number of jobs compared to fossil fuels. Every 1,000 customers connected to decentralized energy solutions  solar home systems or solar mini-grids  supports approximately 25 jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also speaking in support of the guide, Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General, United Nations, said: Access to sustainable energy is pivotal to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement. As we work to recover better from the impacts of COVID-19, African countries have the opportunity to drive faster progress on the energy transition with efficient, renewable energy that protects the most vulnerable, delivers sustainable growth and support climate action.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Riccardo Puliti, World Bank Global Director for Energy and Extractive Industries and Regional Director for Infrastructure in Africa, said: Access to energy is crucial for Africa to recover from the ongoing health, economic and social challenges caused by the pandemic. We welcome this new guide from Sustainable Energy for All that outlines ways in which African countries can seize this unique moment, and in return, unleash economic growth with clean, sustainable energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As countries seek to recover better, SEforALL has highlighted key policy measures that governments should adopt to ensure a successful energy transition in this period. This includes:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ease of doing business: Governments should create a supportive business environment that ensures investments are driven as fast as possible, including significantly reducing red tape, reducing the number of permits required and time it takes to get permits/waivers (if available) for renewable energy and clean cooking equipment and appliances.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Set robust policies and empower national institutions to drive development: Governments need to work now to establish or empower institutions such as regulators and rural electrification agencies to ensure the right frameworks are in place to successfully drive the development of renewables, increased electrification and access to clean cooking.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Eliminate fossil fuel subsidies: With the price of oil the lowest it has been for 18 years; governments must take this opportunity to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. When the price of fossil fuels rises again, governments should refrain from re-introducing the subsidy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Move towards cost-reflective tariffs: The natural tendency for countries will be to cut the cost of electricity, but this should be avoided. The reality is that electricity is largely consumed by wealthier residentials or by industrial/commercial clients. Governments should allow cost-reflective tariffs that allow utilities to perform better and increases investments in energy access and clean energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Other key elements outlined in The Recover Better with Sustainable Energy Guide for African Countries include: Invest in robust data, declare a moratorium on new coal-fired power, invest in energy efficiency and invest in people so they can take advantage of new clean energy jobs.

The guide is part of a series which includes guides for countries in the Caribbean region and Southeast Asia region due to be released soon.

            <link>https://www.eqmagpro.com/mexican-president-orders-fraud-complaints-against-green-power-firms/</link>
            <description> MEXICO CITY: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday ordered formal complaints to be drawn up alleging fraud by mostly renewable power companies, but he gave no evidence backing up the complaints.&#60;p&#62;Ramping up his repeated allegations of corruption in power generation contracts won by mostly wind and solar power companies, Lopez Obrador said that while he remains open to dialogue with the companies, he also wants his aides to prepare the legal complaints against them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We want to talk to the companies one by one. At the same time, Ive given the order to begin drawing up formal complaints, Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lopez Obrador, who has moved on several fronts to centralize more control over energy in state hands, alleged that after the private power firms won supply contracts at auction with state-run electricity company CFE that additional deals were inked that gave them preferential rates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He provided no evidence to support the allegation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since April, the government has sought to prevent more than 40 wind and solar power plants from connecting to the CFE-owned grid, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic requires an uninterrupted power supply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Critics have alleged that Lopez Obrador instead seeks to favor the CFEs mostly fossil fuel-derived power generation, and that he is generally suspicious of any private-sector participation in energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier this month, the president singled out Spains Iberdrola (IBE.MC) for criticism, accusing the power generation company of mounting a media campaign against his government as well as unspecified acts of graft.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Tuesday, Lopez Obrador did not mention any specific companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The power sector dispute directly affects more than $6 billion in partially or already built wind and solar power plants, which judges have allowed to proceed as planned despite the government push to stop them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: reuters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.sakaltimes.com/maharashtra/mahavitaran-and-aeml-announce-emi-option-bill-payment-52601</link>
            <description> In a recent announcement, Energy Minister Nitin Raut declared that state-owned Mahavitarans consumers can now pay their June bills in Equated Monthly Installments (EMI).&#60;p&#62;The lockdown led to an increase in electricity consumption. People have been paying much more for electricity in the last few months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a recent announcement, Energy Minister Nitin Raut declared that state-owned Mahavitarans consumers can now pay their June bills in Equated Monthly Installments (EMI). He also announced that the consumers who pay the bills in one go can also avail a rebate of 2 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission also directed the power suppliers to deal with consumer complaints of inflated bills.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, on this matter, Raut reiterated that the inflated bills were due to high power consumption at home during the lockdown months of April and May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mahavitaran distributes power to eastern suburbs of the city and the districts outside Mumbai.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Following Raut's announcement, a successive announcement was made by Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd (AEML) also announced an EMI offer for its consumers. The AEML supplies electricity from Bandra - Bhayandar and Kurla - Mankhurd. The EMI offer is extended from three - 24 months for the consumers who pay the bill using the app or website at "nominal chargers."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The announcement also mentions that if the meter readings pushed consumers to a higher tax slab then the extra units will be divided between June and July.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over the last few months, citizens have been irritated with the inflated amounts of electricity bills. People have received bills as high as Rs 50,000 and have been blaming the meter readings. People have claimed that the meter reading is faulty and hence are being charged with hefty bill amounts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During the lockdown, the four companies - Mahavitaran, AEML, BEST, TATA - supplying electricity to the state had suspended meter readings. For April and May, the bills were calculated on the basis of the average consumption of the last three months.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After easing of the lockdown on May 31, these companies sent out employees to gather meter readings and compute balance amounts due for April and May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Private coal mining may see weak investor sentiment: ICRA</title>
            <link>https://www.eqmagpro.com/private-coal-mining-may-see-weak-investor-sentiment-icra/</link>
            <description> In FY2020, India imported 243 mt of coal from the seaborne market which entailed a hefty import bill of approximately US$ 21 billion&#60;p&#62;The prospects of commercial coal mining in India may be dimmer than initially expected because of the expected shift in Indias energy mix from fossil fuel-based power to renewable energy. The rollout of this government reform at a time when the economic outlook remains uncertain amid the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to weak investor sentiment, a report by credit ratings agency ICRA said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The domestic coal demand is estimated to increase at a modest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% between FY2021 and FY2027, ICRA estimated. This is much lower than the CAGR of 5.2% registered between FY2013 and FY2020. Given Coal Indias ambitious target to reach 1 billion tonne coal production by FY2024, private commercial miners would face stiff competition in gaining a foothold in the domestic market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a market, where an overwhelming majority of the domestic supply is controlled by Coal India and Singareni Collieries, affordability, dependability and consistency in coal quality would remain critical drivers that would determine if the existing coal customers decide to partly shift their sourcing to private commercial coal miners, Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President &#38; Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA, said. Experienced players, who have the knowhow of efficiently operating a coal mining business, stand a better chance in making a dent in the market share of the existing players. Over the long-term, we believe that coal consumers are likely to benefit from increased competition in the domestic coal mining industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Around 94-95% of Coal Indias overall production comes from opencast mines, having attractive stripping ratios, which have an inherent cost advantage over their peers. Consequently, the operating cost for Coal Indias opencast mines reportedly stood at a competitive 833 per tonne in FY2019. Moreover, out of Coal Indias 582 million tonne (mt) of despatches in FY2020, around 89% has been supplied under long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) where the realisations remain very competitive. Given this cost competitiveness, as well as the arrangements already available to deliver coal to clients plants, threats to any loss in Coal Indias market share in the FSA segment remains low in ICRAs view; consequently the company would continue to dominate the sector in the foreseeable future. However, the geology of the mines belonging to The Singareni Collieries Company Limited remains less favourable, resulting in their operating costs being more than double that of Coal India. Consequently, vulnerability from increased competition remains much higher for Singareni Collieries, whose notified coal prices have an average premium of 40%  125% over Coal Indias notified prices for various grades of coal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In FY2020, India imported 243 mt of coal from the seaborne market which entailed a hefty import bill of approximately US$ 21 billion. Out of this, around 52 mt was coking coal imports, which would be difficult to replace, given its limited domestic reserves. The balance 191 mt of imports was contributed by thermal coal, of which India has abundant reserves.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this regard, Roy added, Indias low-grade thermal coal imports stood at an estimated 110 mt in FY2020, and its import substitution with domestic coal remains a potential opportunity for private commercial miners. For the balance 75-80 mt of high-grade thermal coal imports, options to partly substitute such imports by supplying washed coal to the non-regulated sector also remains a potential area of growth for private commercial miners. Apart from import substitution, increasing market presence in the seaborne export market, and faster adoption of coal-gasification technologies may be other potential avenues of growth for private commercial coal miners.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: icra&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Mahindra To Launch Three Electric Vehicles In Current Financial Year: Here Are All Details</title>
            <link>https://www.drivespark.com/four-wheelers/2020/mahindra-to-launch-at-least-three-electric-vehicles-in-current-financial-year-details-031643.html</link>
            <description> By Punith Bharadwaj Published: Wednesday, July 1, 2020, 10:45 [IST]&#60;p&#62;Mahindra is expected to launch at least three electric vehicles by the end of the current fiscal year. The company has had great success with the current crop of electric three-wheelers sold in the Indian market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the latest reports from Gaadiwaadi, the company plans to expand its range of electric vehicles in the near future. Mahindra plans to launch the Atom electric and the Treo Zor as the demand for commercial electric vehicle continues to grow in the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Alongside the two commercial oriented EVs, the company is also working on introducing the eKUV100 which has been in the pipeline for a long time. Once it arrives, it is expected to be the cheapest electric car sold in the Indian market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mahindra Electric reported that it sold over 14,000 EVs last year, mostly coming from the Tero electric autorickshaws. Despite the ongoing challenging times and production disruptions in the auto sector, the company plans to stay focussed on the electric vehicles segment. The reports also suggest that due to the increased demand for Treo, it has encouraged the company to fast-track the launch process for the Tero Zor as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company has confirmed that it will be working on launching electric vehicles for commercial use alongside mainstream vehicles such as the eKUV100. It reports that the timelines for primary electric vehicles will not be affected due to the increased focus on the commercial segment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on this Pawan Goenka, MD and CEO, Mahindra and Mahindra had said, "Scale for EVs is very important and we would be subscale if we do everything on our own. To get larger volumes and reduce costs we need strategic investments. It is too early to talk about an IPO, we need to first work on profitability and bring down our stake."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Mahesh Babu, MD and CEO of Mahindra Electric, has recently stated that the company has had a great Q4 in the last financial year and reported positive in EBITDA. The company is not looking to sell any of its stakes and is currently looking to increase the investment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also stated that the company is looking for PE co-investors who will be a partner to the company, but Mahindra Group will continue to be the majority stakeholder in the company. Mr Babu further stated that the company is looking to set up a new global R&#38;D centre shortly as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thoughts About The Mahindra To Launch Three Electric Vehicles In Current Financial Year&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mahindra Electric reported that the current challenges in the import of some of the components from China owing to the ongoing tensions between the two countries is temporary. The electric vehicle industry of India will be restored soon as the demand is growing at a rapid rate. As a result, we can expect the upcoming electric vehicles to launch soon in the Indian market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>The impact of COVID-19 on AI adoption</title>
            <link>https://www.peoplematters.in/blog/hr-technology/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-ai-adoption-26180</link>
            <description> While industries are grappling with the fallout of the crisis, some of the advanced technologies abruptly become mainstream in India.&#60;p&#62; Undeniably, the unprecedented COVID 19 crisis has wreaked havoc across the globe, pushing world economies into prolonged lockdown and the business world to a screeching halt. Widely seen as the worst global economic fallout since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the unfathomable COVID 19 crisis has deeply impacted lives of millions across the globe and India is no exception.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The sudden and disruptive onset of crisis has ripple effects on a wide range of industries as well. Though industries such as healthcare, aviation, hospitality, travel &#38; tourism, etc. are the worst-hit, other industries ranging from automobiles to banking, technology to pharma, media to consumer electronics are also being badly affected. While industries are grappling with the fallout of the crisis, some of the advanced technologies abruptly become mainstream in India. It's well said that In the midst of every crisis, lies a great opportunity'; the deadly crisis has opened up new vistas of opportunities for the technology sector in general and Artificial Intelligence in particular. While India, along with other global economies, is on its way to recovery from the crisis, AI is poised to revolutionize various industries through its innovative solutions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the adoption of AI technology has grown exponentially. AI began to play a pivotal role in mitigating the effects on the healthcare sector during the time of the crisis. AI technology has been instrumental in detecting &#38; diagnosing the virus, predicting the evolution and tracking the spread of infections. Besides, there are also other wide array of applications of AI technology such as fast-tracking research on drug discovery, slowing down the spread of infection through contact tracing as well as assisting in recovery. The technology has also eased administration burden of the sector by automating the processes, organising loads of data, prioritizing tasks, creating automatic clinical notes, etc. This resulted in enhanced ability of doctors and caregivers to focus on treating an increased number of patients.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Besides the healthcare sector, AI has been revolutionizing various industries to uphold business resilience. To maintain business continuity during the prolonged lockdown, many industries began to digitize their products and services to reach their potential customers in all possible ways. Education sector has started to use AI big time while even online education start-ups began to offer personalised services in line with the needs and specific requirements of the students. COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the need to transform the conventional education system into one driven by technology. Apart from changing the learning methodology, AI-powered machines also enable educators in a number of ways such as, tracking student performances, identifying gaps in teaching techniques, automating mundane administrative tasks, etc.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The services sector also leveraged AI-enabled chatbots and virtual assistants to improve customer service, reduce costs and address complex customer queries. Banks enhanced their digital outreach to customers to limit the impact of the crisis and help customers in distress. They have transitioned to remote sales and service teams, launched a suite of digital tools, new products and services to help their customers manage debt, adjust budgets, and avail new government programs. Though the technology sector suffered due to low IT spending in recent times, this crisis offered an opportunity for the sector to improve its AI capabilities and help customers sail through the crisis. Besides, a couple of other industries with high end-user touch-points such as insurance and retail are also leveraging AI driven technologies to automate their processes, communications and improve decision making.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Way Forward&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It's no surprise that the COVID-19 crisis and the resultant mobility restrictions has brought in significant changes in consumer behaviour and preferences and there has been increasing usage of digital services. Majority of people who began to use digital channels during lockdown are also likely to continue even after things return to normal. To contain the impact of the crisis, organisations, be it big or small, are also increasingly digitising their products and services.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to a Mckinsey report, pandemic has dramatically catalyzed digital transformation and companies have leapfrogged five years forward in consumer and business digital adoption in a matter of around eight weeks. Given its ability to automate services, boost efficiency, and reduce operational costs, organisations have geared up to leverage AI technology at large. However, keeping in view the requirements of Indian audience, India needs to develop IT platforms that are Made in India and Made for India. Indian IT companies should come forward to address challenges that are so unique to the country keeping in mind the volume of services required here.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This homegrown challenge has resulted in the need for growing usage of AI technology across various industries and has drastically surged the demand for AI professionals with relevant skill-sets. AI-enabled solutions require frequent maintenance and constant intervention by AI professionals such as data scientists and data engineers, to support various applications in their successful implementation. According to Gartner, AI would open up approximately 2.3 million job opportunities. In an attempt to train participants in relevant technical skills and cater to the rising demand for AI professionals, leading Indian academic institutes are partnering with private players to offer a host of online certificate based courses. For example, IIT Ropar has collaborated with TimesTSW to launch a 6 months programme  Post Graduate Certificate Programme in Artificial Intelligence &#38; Deep Learning  which also offers exclusive benefits of alumni status that will help professionals make a career head-start.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Clean Energy Can Support India's Economic Recovery post-Covid-19</title>
            <link>https://www.punekarnews.in/clean-energy-can-support-indias-economic-recovery-post-covid-19/</link>
            <description> New Delhi, 30 June 2020: NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) today released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities&#60;p&#62;for India's Energy and Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The report identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country's leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India's transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that India's economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. India's strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Clean energy will be a major driver of India's economic recovery and international competitiveness, added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhousesthe transport and power sectorsand emerge stronger.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support India's clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India's public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India, said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone's lives, said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The report states that India's transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Continue Reading&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Punekar News is now on Telegram.

            <title>High-Power Wireless Charging System Goes Into Trial</title>
            <link>http://www.cleanfuture.co.in/2020/07/01/high-power-wireless-charging-trial/</link>
            <description> The high-power wireless charging systems from Momentum Dynamics are going into a trial program with Jaguar I-PACE electric taxis in Oslo, Norway.&#60;p&#62;The program will also include Nordic taxi operator Cabonline (NorgesTaxi AS) and Fortum Recharge, which is the largest provider of EV charging points in Norway.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The program is being called ElectriCity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Multiple charging plates rated at 50-75 kilowatts each, are installed in the ground in series at pick-up-drop-off points. This allows each equipped taxi to automatically charge while queuing for the next fare.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Wireless Charging System Graphic&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The system, which uses no cables and is situated below ground, requires no physical connection between charger and vehicle, engages automatically and provides on average 6-8 minutes of energy per each charge up to 50kW.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Assuming a decent balance between driving and waiting for passengers (and a change of drivers once or twice), a vehicle could be in operation 24/7. In a city like London with an Ultra Low Emissions Zone or a requirement that taxis be electric, this is extra valuable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The wireless system was integrated by Momentum and Jaguar Land Rover engineers into the I-PACE in a matter of weeks, even with the difficulties of COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This project perfectly outlines the automatic electric taxi charging model for any city looking to implement zero emission transportation. Though, even simple economics should do the job to push this solution forward.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Reference- Stockhouse PR, Momentum Dynamics website, Electrek, Clean Technica, Futurism&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Related&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;50 MWh Of Wireless Charging Completed For Electric Bus Fleet&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In Wenatchee, Washington, Link Transit chose wireless charging for electric buses way back in 2018. According to Momentum Dynamics, which provided the wireless charging solutions, the choice was made in part due to the high efficiency of its system. The key selling point, naturally, is this allowed an electric bus&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;May 27, 2020 In "Technology"&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Wireless Hands Free EV Charging For Fleet Operators&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Wireless EV charging would be a nifty convenience for personal electric vehicle owners, and it looks like auto makers have tuned into the luxury car angle.

            <title>The Clean Car Revolution Is Breaking Old Industrial Towns</title>
            <link>https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/spain-nissan-closures-clean-car-revolution-leaves-towns-broken</link>
            <description> (Bloomberg) -- Patricia Notario's life started unraveling when she first heard rumors that Nissan Motor Co. would shutter its car factories in Barcelona.&#60;p&#62; It was in the midst of Spain's state of emergency to contain the coronavirus, and the 36-year-old and her partner, also a Nissan employee, were confined to their home like millions of others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The couple had put all their savings into a new apartment a few months earlier and were awaiting a decision about their mortgage. After the carmaker  which has been building vehicles at the site since before Notario was born  confirmed the news in late May, the fallout was brutal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The bank rejected the couple's loan application, the owner balked at returning their 40,000-euro ($45,000) down payment, and the temporary housing the couple had rented until they could move into their new home turned into a type of limbo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Our future is black, said Notario, staring at a blank TV screen.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; She's not alone. About 25,000 workers in the Spanish industrial hub have their livelihoods on the line. It's a scene that could play out in car towns around the world as the coronavirus crisis accelerates a structural shift in the overcrowded, fast-changing auto industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Nissan's decision to shut down its three plants in the scrubby hills outside Barcelona is part of a broader reorganization with alliance partners Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which involves cutting global production by 20%. The move is linked to the broader strains facing the sector as the era of the combustion engine gradually draws to a close.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The transformation of the auto industry is unstoppable, it's a new industrial revolution, and the only alternative is to adapt or die, said Tomas Diaz, a Nissan worker and an official with the Comissions Obreres union in the Catalonia region. Today is Nissan, but tomorrow it can be any other plant.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Car sales are plunging, and a recovery is expected to be long and slow. The prospects for traditional vehicles are particularly gloomy. Major economies, accounting for 13% of global car deliveries, have committed to phase out diesel and gasoline engines, some as early as 2025.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; An 87% decline in battery prices in the past decade and a green push by the European Union will drive electric car sales up in Europe from just over half a million last year to 2 million in 2025, Bloomberg NEF predicts.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Car plants, long a provider of middle-class incomes for blue-collar workers, are being separated into two classes: those with a future in the electric world and those that will be sidelined sooner or later.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If nothing changes, Notario, her partner and Spain's other 600,000 auto workers will be left out of the green jobs revolution. While some electric models are assembled in Europe's second-biggest auto producer, all of the region's electric-car supply chain is concentrated in northern Europe and Asia, where the batteries are developed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; You could see the factory had less production, said Notario, as her 11-year-old son plays video games in the next room. We never had the feeling the plant would close.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Workers have been on indefinite strike since early May. They gather for weekly updates outside Nissan's Montcada i Reixac plant  a stamping facility that supplies nearby factories, effectively halting all the company's operations in the area.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Signs of anger are everywhere. A tower with the Nissan logo is stained with red paint. Along the factory fence, workers hung uniforms smeared with slogans such as our virus is the closure and worker for sale.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A protest camp has been dubbed La Resistance, and the name is emblazoned on a blue trailer truck nearby. A small cafe serves snacks and sandwiches to raise money for the strike fund. Picket lines are manned around the clock to prevent supplies and machinery moving out.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On a rainy day in June, union leaders climbed a precarious set of metallic stairs to address about 400 people. Four assemblies had been called that day to keep the crowd small and comply with social-distancing requirements. Workers wearing blue surgical masks listened in silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Officials tried to rally the group by questioning Nissan's argument that the plant is no longer competitive. They sought to sow hope by asserting that a closure could be avoided if Renault takes over. If all else fails, they urged the government to make it harder for Nissan to fire people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When the speeches finish, workers throw fists in the air and chant: Nissan won't close, Nissan won't close. But there's little real prospects their pleas will be heard.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We did not find any viable solution or alternative, due to overall capacity globally and regionally, Gianluca de Ficchy, chairman of Nissan Europe, said in a statement to Bloomberg, adding that the process is moving ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And Renault, like most other carmakers, has its own issues. The French manufacturer, which has three sites in Spain, is wrestling with the politically tricky task of lowering capacity and cutting jobs at home. Vehicle assembly could be phased out at some factories like Flins near Paris, while two other sites could be closed or sold, sparking the ire of unions and intense political scrutiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Montcada i Reixac is north of Barcelona, far from the sea and the vibrant Catalan capital. Squeezed between highways and pierced by a cement factory, industry is part of the town's makeup  about 200 cargo and passenger trains, rumble through every day. Mayor Laura Campos is following the developments with dismay.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Hundreds of families from this town have worked in the auto industry, going back generations, said Campos as she waited patiently at a railway crossing for a train to pass. A Nissan closure would be a catastrophe of epic dimensions, both economically and socially.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Much of the town's industry disappeared during the financial crisis, which hit Spain hard. While the recovery brought in some new employers, many are logistics operations which employ less people and pay lower salaries, leaving many families vulnerable, said Campos.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We need a full industrial plan, or we will be out of the game in the next five years, said Josep Maria Vall, head of Catalan Automotive Industry Cluster, a lobby group that represents local suppliers. We still have our last shot, but if we miss this opportunity, we probably won't be able to ever recover.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Spain's cash-strapped government unveiled a 3.75 billion-euro stimulus program for the car industry earlier in June. About 500 million euros is earmarked for promoting new technologies and retraining workers. The rest will mostly go toward programs to replace older vehicles with new ones, including diesel and gasoline cars.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The indirect boost to local auto plants is only temporary, and a longer term plan is needed. Barcelona's Zona Franca industrial site hosts an incubator for 3D-printing startups near another Nissan plant affected by the closure. The Catalan government is hustling for new investment, but competition is tough, according to Economy Minister Pere Aragones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are working to have the maximum number of investments in the electric-car value chain in Catalonia, he said. This is a moment of transformation for the whole sector, and we think that with every difficulty comes an opportunity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Jordi Fernandez, Notario's partner who has started to study for a technical degree, has a worried look on his face after returning from the plant.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I keep thinking about people finishing school, some will get a university degree and they'll be fine, said Fernandez. But how about people like us  those that will never study at a university, or that can't afford it? Where are they going to work?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#194;&#169;2020 Bloomberg L.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bloomberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Missing BloombergQuint's WhatsApp service?

            <title>Why Robogyaan's DIY kits will give your kids the robotic push they all need to make one today</title>
            <link>https://www.edexlive.com/happening/2020/jul/01/why-robogyaans-diy-kits-will-give-your-kids-the-robotic-push-they-all-need-to-make-one-today-12996.html</link>
            <description> Guntur-based Robogyaan helps students pick up robotics easily via their simple kits. Their co-founder and CTO is Sai Saandeep Sadu and their mentor is Dr Hafeez Basha. Together, they make one team&#60;p&#62;What started as Schoolronics in September 2016 to educate the students of Guntur about electric concepts using hands-on kits evolved into Robogyaan in December 2018 to include, you guessed it, Robotics, IoT (Internet of Things) and AI too. Why Sitaram Tallam, the Co-founder and CEO of the start-up, felt the need to evolve is pretty obvious, to help students stay in tandem with the changing needs of the time. But how did they manage to do so? Sitaram who trained at the Indian School of Business in entrepreneurship, brought on a team of eight (though most of them have left now) to revamp their start-up, which had already conducted its first 14 workshops for free. "We have also been chosen as mentors for the Atal Innovation Mission of NITI Aayog and we establish Atal Tinkering Labs and offer to maintain it for a year too. In this way, we are furthering our goal of taking technology, innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit to the interiors of our city," says the 22-year-old. And now, we hear that Sitaram has bagged the Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) Scholarship through which he intends to take his start-up Robogyaan to the Land of Rising Robotics. Hooray!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The Norway-based consultancy, which advises both petroleum and renewable energy companies on risk management and technology, said global energy use would be 8 per cent lower in 2050 than previously expected due to the impact of the pandemic&#60;p&#62;OSLO: Global oil demand and carbon dioxide emissions probably peaked in 2019 as the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on both, energy consultancy DNV GL said on Wednesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Norway-based consultancy, which advises both petroleum and renewable energy companies on risk management and technology, said global energy use would be 8 per cent lower in 2050 than previously expected due to the impact of the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Lasting behavioural changes to travel, commuting and working habits will also decrease energy usage and lessen demand for fossil fuels from the transport sector as well as from iron and steel production," DNV GL said in a statement about its research on the impact of the pandemic on oil demand and emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"While we expect oil demand to recover next year, we think that it's likely that it will never reach the levels seen in 2019," Sverre Alvik, head of DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook, told Reuters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The International Energy Agency said on June 16, it did not expect oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 due to a slump in air travel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;DNV GL has previously predicted oil demand would plateau in 2022.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Growing scepticism about long-term global oil demand in a post-pandemic world is putting pressure on oil companies to revalue their assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shell said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the outlook for energy prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Renewable energy is seen benefiting from the crisis, because when total energy demand falls, the cheapest sources, such as wind and solar, are preferred to fossil fuels, Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While global CO2 emissions also likely peaked in 2019, the expected decline in future would not be steep enough to meet the Paris climate agreement goals, so other measures such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater use of hydrogen were needed, DNV GL said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has shown that behavioural changes are indeed possible, and we can use this opportunity to make a change which is good for (the) climate," Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Things were tough in early June, now there is stability, says Manish Sisodia</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/things-were-tough-in-early-june-now-there-is-stability-says-manish-sisodia/ar-BB16alC2</link>
            <description> Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds temporary charge of the state health ministry, spoke to HT about where Delhi stands in&#60;p&#62;the Covid-19 fight, working with the Centre on formulating strategies, ramping up testing, the positivity rate, community transmission, home isolation, and the state's finances, among other issues. Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, we are in a comfortable situation. If you ask me about the peak, the time between June 8 and June 15, or rather the first two weeks of June, were a bit hard. We have seen stability after that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, when we were testing 5,000-6,000 people, about 2,000 were testing positive. Now, we are doing anywhere between 17,000 and 22,000 tests, and 3,000 are testing positive. This means there is stability in the number of cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If we look at the number of beds, the peak need was 6,200 beds. Now, it is close to 5,800-5,900this shows that there is stability in the number of beds needed. Deaths are also under control; not a huge spike.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Considering the character of this virus and what we are seeing across the globe, it will be wrong if I conclude that we will no longer see those jerks or spikes again. This phase, which I am calling a stable one, might be temporary phase, which is why surveillance and surveys, which are currently happening in the city, are very important.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; What I said back then was the ground reality of the time. Now, whether the decision to share the projection of Covid cases with the public was right or wrong is very subjective. My viewpoint is that by throwing the numbers out in the open, a sense of urgency came in all of us, including the Centre. It is because of that alert that all stakeholders, including the central government, our government, NGOs and municipal corporations, came together. I feel sharing data with the public always proves to be beneficial.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; These projections were made based on a formula given by the government of India (GoI), which has created a portal for this, and that is what we're following. The projection of the total number of cases at present is not very different from the projection of 1 lakh cases by June-end that we had made back then. But other numbers are very different now. For example, we had then projected that active cases would be around 60,000 by now, but at present, we have only around 26,000 active cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No, today also we are doing all arrangements based on the same assessment made in the beginning of June. Our target was to prepare 15,000 beds. We have that today. We also have more than enough beds in quarantine centres. There are more than 8,500 quarantine beds ready, and only over 1,700 of them are currently occupied.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We were expecting that over 15,000 beds would be required, but now only around 5,900 beds are being utilised. In between, bed occupancy had peaked at 6,200 but things have improved since then.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At present, there are some signs of stability with the recovery rate improving and the positivity rate declining. This stability gives us hope, but we cannot be under the illusion that no more preparation is required.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The good thing is that Delhi's recovery rate is very promising. Today's recovery rate is 63.3%. This has helped us build confidence among the people in the chief minister's five weapons to fight Corona. Testing is being scaled up, and based on that, symptomatic cases are being isolated. More beds than what is required are being set up. The fourth is plasma therapy, which has shown positive results in Delhi. And the last one is survey and screening.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I agree that ventilators are the need of the hour, which is why I just took a meeting to review this matter, and we are working to augment it further. The central government has also helped us in this, but we are also procuring machines on our own. Every major Delhi government hospital has also been asked to chalk out a plan on how their capacity can be increased further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I stand by what the chief minister said yesterday - credit sara unka, zaroorat saari humari (credit all theirs, need all ours).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One good thing is that with the Centre's help, we have got some staff now in our dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We have got staff from ITBP who are manning the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and hospital. At present, they have given staff for 1,000 beds, but I hope they will provide more personnel for all the 10,000 beds when they are utilised. Besides, we have got some oxygen cylinders, ventilators and rail coaches from the Centre.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But this pandemic is so unprecedented that if any government or stakeholder claims that the situation was stabilised solely because of them, it would be too much. The good thing today is that all three - the Central government, the Delhi government and civil society - are working together in good coordination with each other. This is not the time to do post-mortems on who failed or passed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Difference of opinion is always there, and it is natural. There were some decisions taken by them (Central government and the Lieutenant-Governor), which we opposed in our discussions with them. We even kept our view in the public forum, sought views, and they withdrew those decisions. But, these things keep happening. It is a part of the process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Right now, in our hospitals, we are bypassing all government processes to appoint medical staff on an immediate basis. All our medical directors have been authorised or empowered to create posts and fill them. We have decentralised the system, which has helped a lot. The municipal corporations are doing their bit in conducting surveys.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes, MHA has not given us any standard operating procedure (SOP) on how this is to be done. This was recommended by the Centre's expert committee headed by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog. Once we get the SOP, then we will discuss it with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We have issued a tender to rope in a private firm so that the follow-up process of home isolation patients is outsourced like before. In the meantime, we are trying to cope with whatever resources we have. We have put our staff from mohalla clinics and teams of district surveillance officers on the job as of now. But this is not sufficient.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are again going to outsource the tele-counselling task to a private firm. Which company gets the job will be known once the tender process is over. It will be finalised in a day or two.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; They (Centre) have asked for the data; we provided it. Now, pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators are also available; this has made home isolation a great solution. So far, more than 52,000 people have recovered.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the beginning of June, there were some issues - there were times when it took two-three hours for the admission of patients; now it takes a maximum of 10 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Centre said in the past that deaths happening in first one to three days of hospital admission implied that home isolation protocols were not being followed strictly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If a person is eligible for home isolation as per ICMR protocols - we have not set up our own protocols - it is much better if they stay at home rather than going to the Covid centres.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If someone needs hospitalisation, there is zero compromise on our end and from our medical teams. After reaching the hospitals, yes, there were some issues at the beginning. Now, the app is working really well and all the problems have been rectified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I feel that a lot of things will become clear after the sero surveillance study is done.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Earlier, 20% of the cases were reported from containment areas, 40% from clusters, and almost 40% were isolated cases. Now the clusters have also been included in the containment zones. That's why the increase in the number of zones.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Actually, when you confirm community transmission, then rather than contact tracing, you focus on facilitating medical care. We are already doing that. But, yes, the resource and manpower that is focused on containment and tracing will no longer be a worry if you accept community transmission.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, we need to understand that Delhi is not a small city. In the same city, there could be a colony where community transmission could be ongoing but another colony in the same city might be very less affected. You cannot have the same yardstick for both. In a city like Delhi, you will still have to have multiple strategies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Every day, we are doing up to 20,000 tests. The main benefit is that we have been able to scale up testing. There is a limit to RT-PCR testing. That is why we are purchasing 5 lakh more tests so that we can increase it more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the benefit of rapid testing -- you can do it at a large scale. You cannot scale up RT-PCR to that level.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are moving towards 40,000 tests a day. And, the day we do that, it is possible that 4,000 people will test positive, I am prepared for that.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No. Our collection for the first quarter of last year was 7,275 crore. This year it is approximately 2,500 crore only. So, our collection has been just one-third compared to last year. And, this is only GST and VAT. Excise, registry, and car sales have also stopped - that data has not been included in this. Total revenue in these categories must be only about 10% of the usual revenue.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Since there is so much cooperation going on, and the Union home minister is also doing such handholding, I hope he will help us in this regard as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for 5,000 crore, but we are yet to hear from her. If we get this money - and I hope the Centre will give it - along with the GST compensation, then we can manage easily.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Let us see. It is very difficult for me to say what the situation will be in July or August. The Government of India also said yesterday that schools will remain closed. We had assessed this a few days ago and announced our decision. It will take time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Sign on to read the HT ePaper&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MARKET COMMENTARY Markets continue to trade in green in morning session</title>
            <link>http://www.citrusinteractive.in/News/OpenNewsContent.aspx?SecId=4&#38;SubSecID=41&#38;NewsID=786905</link>
            <description> Indian equity markets continued to trade in green zone in morning session due to sustained buying by investors and domestic financial institutions, also positive cues from other Asian markets supporting the markets. Traders also found some solace with Union Minister Nitin Gadkaris statement that the government is looking at ways to boost India's exports. He is also hopeful that a solution will be found in the next 4-6 months to address the issue of delay in payment to micro, small and medium enterprises. Adding to the optimism, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said India's economy will recover following the containment of COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing reforms would keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers. However, further up-move got restricted as Fitch Ratings lowered India's growth forecast for 2021-22 fiscal to 8 percent from 9.5 percent projected last month. The rating agency retained its projection of Indian economy contracting by 5 percent in the current fiscal. On the sectoral front, automotive component sectors stocks were in focus as CRISIL Ratings in its report said that supply chain disruptions in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak coupled with weak demand for vehicles in India and overseas is likely to squeeze the revenue of the automotive component sector by 16 percent this fiscal.&#60;p&#62;On the global front, Asian markets were trading mostly in green, following the positive cues from Wall Street despite the continued spike in new coronavirus cases in several U.S. states and across the world. Also, the latest survey from Caixin showed that the manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in June, and at a faster rate, with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.2. That's up from 50.7 in May and it moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The BSE Sensex is currently trading at 35127.10, up by 211.30 points or 0.61% after trading in a range of 34927.20 and 35152.32. There were 19 stocks advancing against 11 stocks declining on the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The broader indices were trading in green; the BSE Mid cap index rose 0.06%, while Small cap index was up by 0.27%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Energy up by 0.80%, Bankex up by 0.75%, Auto up by 0.50%, Consumer Durables up by 0.43% and Realty up by 0.43%, while Power down by 1.37%, Capital Goods down by 1.31%, Utilities down by 0.81%, Industrials down by 0.54% and Healthcare down by 0.30% were the top losing indices on BSE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gainers on the Sensex were Axis Bank up by 2.37%, Indusind Bank up by 2.22%, SBI up by 2.02%, HDFC up by 1.93% and Bajaj Finance up by 1.88%. On the flip side, NTPC down by 2.82%, Larsen &#38; Toubro down by 2.15%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.04%, ONGC down by 1.29% and Nestle down by 1.01% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings in its June update of Global Economic Outlook has lowered India's growth forecast for financial year 2021-22 to 8 percent from 9.5 percent projected last month. However, the rating agency retained its projection of Indian economy contracting by 5 percent in the current fiscal (FY21). It projected Indian economy to grow 5.5 percent in 2022-23.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It said in India, where authorities imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns globally to try to halt the spread of the virus, measures are being relaxed only very gradually; with a limited policy easing response and ongoing financial sector fragilities, we have pared our 2021 forecast to 8 percent from 9.5 percent in the previous GEO.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier, in May update to the outlook, Fitch had projected 9.5 percent growth in 2021-22. It had exuded confidence that the Indian economy will bounce back from the prevailing contraction and slowdown largely on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic and projected India's GDP to grow at a healthy rate in the next fiscal year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The CNX Nifty is currently trading at 10350.45, up by 48.35 points or 0.47% after trading in a range of 10299.60 and 10363.40. There were 31 stocks advancing against 19 stocks declining on the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gainers on Nifty were UPL up by 3.12%, Axis Bank up by 2.24%, Indusind Bank up by 2.12%, Vedanta up by 2.11% and HDFC up by 1.85%. On the flip side, NTPC down by 2.97%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.45%, Larsen &#38; Toubro down by 2.17%, Bharti Infratel down by 1.99% and ONGC down by 1.78% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Asian markets were trading mostly in green; Taiwan Weighted strengthened 107.09 points or 0.92% to 11,728.33, Shanghai Composite gained 27.10 points or 0.91% to 3,011.77, Straits Times advanced 24.72 points or 0.95% to 2,614.63, KOSPI rose 9.97 points or 0.47% to 2,118.30. On the flip side, Jakarta Composite lost 15.58 points or 0.32% to 4,889.81 and Nikkei 225 slipped 122.17 points or 0.55% to 22,165.97.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) had rolled out a new regulation last year, forcing waste incinerators to reveal real-time emission and temperature data to the public as well as to upload it to the environmental bureau monitoring system&#60;p&#62;BEIJING: China will cut or suspend subsidy for waste-to-energy (WTE) power plants that violate emission standards, as part of its anti-pollution campaign, the country's finance and environment ministries said late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The move, effective July 1, aims at improving environmental levels at WTE power plants and mitigating public discontent with stench and the risk of toxic emissions, such as dioxin.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) had rolled out a new regulation last year, forcing waste incinerators to reveal real-time emission and temperature data to the public as well as to upload it to the environmental bureau monitoring system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government will cut or even suspend the subsidy for the WTE power generators that are found not revealing emission data or forging the data or not reaching the standards, according to the joint statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China has vowed to build waste incineration handling capacity of 591,400 tonnes per day by 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At end 2019, China had installed WTE power generation capacity of 12.02 gigawatts (GW) and daily incineration capacity of 490,000 tonnes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to China's Biomass Energy Association, the country is expected to add 2.9 GW WTE power generation capacity in 2020, requiring a subsidy of about 11.1 billion yuan ($1.57 billion).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Beijing has been striving to curtail financial supports to renewable power sources in order to ease a backlog of subsidy payment exceeding 223 billion yuan, which may shadow the development of WTE projects in the pipeline.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Energy Minister Nitin Raut says Mahavitaran consumers get a 2% rebate if they pay their June bill in one go.&#60;p&#62; A day after the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission directed all power utilities in the state to deal with complaints of inflated bills, Energy Minister Nitin Raut said the state-owned Mahavitaran 's consumers can pay their June bill in three EMIs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Consumers who pay their bill in one go will get a rebate of 2 per cent, while those who have already made the payment can claim the reduction in the next cycle.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Raut, however, reiterated Mahavitaran's stand on allegations of inflated bills, saying the dues were higher owing to increased power consumption in April and May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mahavitaran distributes power to the eastern suburbs of Mumbai and districts outside Mumbai.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Soon after Raut's announcement, Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd (AEML), which distributes power from Bandra to Bhayandar and Kurla to Mankhurd, offered an EMI facility of three to 24 months at nominal charges for those who pay via its website or its app.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It also said if meter readings of April and May pushed consumers on to a higher tariff slab, the extra units will be divided among readings of June and July. Electricity tariff is based on a telescopic structure and it is calculated based on slabs of 0-100 units, 101-300 units, 301-500 units, and 501 and above.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Irate citizensfrom middle class families to Bollywood celebrities have been complaining for days about receiving hefty bills as high as Rs 50,000, and have blamed faulty meter readings and inaccurate computation based on average consumption during the lockdown period. All four power utility companies in the stateMahavitaran, AEML, BEST and Tata Power Company Ltdhad suspended physical meter readings in March owing to the pandemic. For April and May, the bills were calculated based on the average readings of the previous three months, before the advent of summer. When the lockdown was eased on May 31, the companies sent their employees out to note meter readings and billed consumers for the balance amount based on the actual consumption during April and May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In defence of the high power bills, the companies have said that summer months usually register an increase in power consumption. With the lockdown in place, which meant people spent more time at home, the resultant readings were, therefore, subsequently high, they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>E.ON &#38; thyssenkrupp Bring Hydrogen Production on the Electricity Market</title>
            <link>https://steelguru.com/steel/e-on-thyssenkrupp-bring-hydrogen-production-on-the-electricity-market/560768</link>
            <description> E.ON and thyssenkrupp are making hydrogen technology more intelligent: large-scale electrolysis plants, which plant manufacturer thyssenkrupp offers&#60;p&#62;to industry, can now be linked to the electricity market in Germany via E.ONs virtual power plant. This makes the plants electricity market ready. In this way, industrial hydrogen production can contribute to the efficient integration of green electricity into the energy system. The principle is that if there is a high demand in the power grid, the plant will shut down hydrogen production so that the energy required for electrolysis is available to the public power supply. Conversely, hydrogen production is ramped up if more energy is fed into the grid than can be distributed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This innovation makes so-called Power-to-X systems more attractive for the industry. The operator of a plant can market his willingness to adapt flexibly to general electricity demand and thus generate additional income on the electricity market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This process is automatically controlled by the E.ON Virtual Power Plant. This software platform links various mostly industrial producers and bulk purchasers of energy and controls the generation and consumption of these customers according to the current network load. In this way, the Virtual Power Plant makes a significant contribution to compensating for the fluctuating electricity production from renewable energy in the power grid.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;thyssenkrupp and E.ON successfully tested the system at the Carbon2Chem pilot plant with a capacity of up to two megawatts in Duisburg. E.ON has also checked that the plant meets all the requirements for participation in the balancing power market. Due to the high reaction speed of the thyssenkrupp plant, the technology can even participate in the market for high-quality primary control power. This was tested with the transmission system operator successfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;thyssenkrupp and E.ON are now cooperating on marketing. Effective immediately, thyssenkrupp is marketing the Power-to-X technology with the additional option of coupling the system to the virtual power plant. E.ON offers customers the option of operating the power plant optimized for the power market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>EU Steel Safeguard Decision Detrimental to European Steel Recovery</title>
            <link>https://steelguru.com/steel/eu-steel-safeguard-decision-detrimental-to-european-steel-recovery/560773</link>
            <description> IndustriAll European Trade Union and the European Steel Association EUROFER have reiterated their deep disappointment at the EUs decision to not&#60;p&#62;adjust the tariff-free import quota for steel in the light of the collapse in EU steel demand. The steel sector had called for significant, short-term changes to the EU steel safeguards to preserve the industry during this pandemic-induced economic downturn. IndustriAll Europe Deputy General Secretary Mr Luis Colunga said This is the worst crisis we have seen in decades, and it represents a failure to exploit the safeguard tool to the fullest possible extent. This may risk thousands of jobs and could cost taxpayers billions if the ensuing closures of steel facilities throughout Europe cannot be prevented by other measures. We need an emergency meeting with EU policymakers. Together we can work on solutions to rescue the strategically vital European steel sector. Only a robust domestic industry can reliably contribute to completing the circular economy, continue the transition to carbon neutrality, and ensure the welfare of Europes people.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;EUROFER Director General Axel Eggert said We have seen a collapse of 50% in EU steel demand since March, but the tariff-free import quota has been further raised. Objectively, this makes no sense. We had expected a clear decision for European industry. This did not happen. The resulting marginal technical changes may help one or other steel product group but most of our industry has been left in the cold. We are ready and willing to sit down with policy makers with an open mind in order to develop a way forward for our sector and the downstream sectors it services, emphasised Mr Eggert. The result of the revised safeguards is a major upset, and the EU must still find ways and means to avoid further closures and job losses in the European steel sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 9 June, several Member States had urged the Commission to make adjustments to the safeguard review proposal, though they stopped short of calling for the drastic quota reduction and elimination of unused quotas requested by the steel industry. Only minor changes have been made to the proposals following Member State pressure, these are not enough in the current changed circumstances, according to the industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

The Carlyle Group will acquire approximately 25 per cent stake in Airtel's Data Centre business at a valuation of US$1.2 billion. The post-money enterprise valuation of Nxtra is approximately US$1.2 billion and Carlyle will hold a stake of approximately 25% in the business upon completion of the transaction, with Airtel continuing to hold the remaining stake of approximately 75%, the company said in a press release.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Jindal Steel and Power on Tuesday said it would transfer its entire stake in its Oman asset, Jindal Shadeed Iron and Steel, to another promoter group firm, Templar Investments, for an enterprise value of over $1 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Yes Bank is in advanced talks with a clutch of domestic and international private equity (PE) funds, who are expected to acquire stakes in the lender and a deal is likely to be locked by mid-July, people aware of the development told FE. The lender plans to raise Rs 15,000-crore capital through share sale, ADRs, GDRs and bonds to meet its capital needs for two years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; BoB informed in an exchange filing that the committee of the bank approved the issuance of Basel III compliant additional Tier I bonds for an aggregate total size not exceeding Rs 2,000 crore in single or multiple tranches.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; L&#38;T said that it has achieved an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena under Make in India' initiative by building the most complex and final assembly of Cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>(OFFICIAL)-World agencies step in as pandemic poverty hits artisanal miners</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/health/1111606-official-world-agencies-step-in-as-pandemic-poverty-hits-artisanal-miners</link>
            <description> From a $15 million World Bank fund to an experimental gold-buying project in&#60;p&#62;Burkina Faso, development agencies are delivering financial aid to subsistence miners the COVID-19 pandemic has impoverished. World market prices of gold - viewed by investors as a safe store of value in uncertain times - have surged to levels last seen in 2012, and are up 16% this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But millions of subsistence workers, who typically use rudimentary techniques at unregulated mines, have received none of the benefits as pandemic disruption to supply lines has shrunk their already sporadic earnings. For an interactive graphic click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yufhV6&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The World Bank is creating a dedicated emergency relief fund for the estimated 40 million artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) worldwide, three sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. A World Bank spokeswoman confirmed the fund, which was yet to be officially launched. She said the fund would "provide short-term assistance to artisanal mining communities to better cope with COVID-19 impacts".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Donors have contributed $5 million to the fund, and the Bank aims to expand it to $15 million. That money would be disbursed to projects helping miners across geographies and minerals. "This is very rare because usually disaster recovery funding is not specifically directed to ASM as a uniquely vulnerable livelihood group," said one consultant, who declined to be named.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Canada-based Artisanal Gold Council (AGC), an NGO, is trying out a project to help communities dependent on small-scale gold mining in Burkina Faso. With 40% of the population living below the national poverty line, the country is particularly vulnerable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The AGC has bought gold direct from miners at the pre-pandemic going rate, and is in early discussions with PAMP, a London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) certified refinery in&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Switzerland, about exporting it there for refining. PAMP declined a request for an interview, and did not reply to written questions from Reuters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The gold, sourced from five artisanal miners around the southern town of Dano, was transported to the capital, Ouagadougou, and was in the process of being certified for export by the mines ministry. The initial export, of 800 grammes of gold (worth around $48,847), is a trial. Depending on its success, the AGC plans to source a further 20kg from Burkina Faso, and then begin sourcing from Colombia too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Aboubakar Dabire, a miner who sold 500 grammes of gold to the AGC, said: "My community was really hard hit by COVID-19. When gold prices are low, everything is undermined." "People will take this seriously as it is a well-organised system," Dabire added. "It means they will make an effort to avoid certain buyers in the field who are ruining the market."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Attempts to formalise artisanal mining, stamp out child labour, and sever links with illicit minerals trade face significant obstacles. In remote artisanal gold mining communities, trade is largely informal and the rigorous documentation required by LBMA guidelines is hard to enforce.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These guidelines require gold refineries to verify where their gold is mined, show it does not fund conflict or armed groups, collect "Know Your Customer" information on the whole supply chain, and verify all legal taxes have been paid. It took the AGC two months to complete the process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The challenges help to explain why only a tiny share of the gold produced worldwide is "London Good Delivery" certified by the LBMA. In Africa, 1.6% of gold is. For an interactive graphic click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ABHD0j The effort and cost required to implement these standards and bring artisanal gold into formal channels mean other NGOs do not consider direct market intervention, such as that being done by AGC, viable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We are very aware that prices are depressed for local miners, but we are not convinced the international market is the route to go down," David Finlay, responsible minerals manager at the Fairtrade Foundation, said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> ULEVs, mostly battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a smaller number using hydrogen fuel cells, emit less than 75 grammes of carbon dioxide from the tailpipe per kilometre travelled&#60;p&#62;LONDON: Britain's transition from petroleum to electricity in road transport is accelerating, albeit from a low base, and will start to have a significant impact on oil consumption towards the end of the decade.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) accounted for nearly 7 per cent of all new cars registered in Britain during the first quarter of 2020, up from just over 2 per cent in the same periods in 2019 and 2018.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ULEVs, mostly battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a smaller number using hydrogen fuel cells, emit less than 75 grammes of carbon dioxide from the tailpipe per kilometre travelled.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There are now almost 280,000 ultra-low emission cars registered, up from less than 100,000 three years ago ("Vehicle licensing statistics", U.K. Department for Transport, June 30).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the end of March, there were almost 110,000 battery electric cars and 155,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars, with small numbers using other ULEV technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Policy support is gradually switching from hybrids to pure battery electric cars to maximise the reduction in tailpipe emissions ("Electric vehicles and infrastructure", House of Commons, March 25).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the past year, registrations of battery electric cars have overtaken hybrids for the first time, which should result in a further electrification of the fleet over the next few years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ultra-low emission cars of all types still make up less than 1 per cent of the 32 million cars registered but the proportion has almost tripled in the last three years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New registrations for ultra-low emission cars have been rising at an annual rate of 30-40 per cent compared with growth of just 1-2 per cent for all cars, which implies rapidly rising market penetration (https://tmsnrt.rs/3eNmf7E).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New technology products (motor cars, refrigerators, and televisions) and services (gas, electricity, telephones, water and sewerage) have tended to spread through a population following an S-shaped logistic curve.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The initial invention is often followed by decades of small-scale use and trial-and-error, before the technology rapidly diffuses on a much larger scale. Eventually the market becomes saturated, limiting further spreading.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fitting S-curves to emerging new technologies is risky: some subsequently fail to reach take-off or are overtaken by rival technologies and end up reaching only a fraction of the potential number of users.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Estimating the diffusion rate that underlies the logistic curve is especially prone to error in the early years when the number of current users is very low and growth rates are volatile.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nonetheless, there are good theoretical reasons to assume the transition to electric vehicles will follow a logistic curve, and the observed growth in ULEV market share in Britain does appear to fit a logistic curve.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If ultra-low emission cars diffuse through the population following the fitted logistic curve, they will account for about 25 per cent of all new registrations by 2027, 50 per cent by 2031 and 75 per cent by 2035.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The implied transition to electric-powered vehicles is broadly consistent with the government's stated ambition of ensuring at least 50 per cent, and as much as 70 per cent, of all new car sales are ultra-low emission vehicles by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ambition was set out by the Department for Transport two years ago in a major strategy paper ("The Road to Zero: Next steps towards cleaner road transport and delivering our industrial strategy", July 9, 2018).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The timetable for the transition is also consistent with the government's announced plan to prohibit the sale of gasoline and diesel cars from 2040.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban on gasoline and diesel car sales could be brought forward to 2035 under proposals the government has published for consultation ("Decarbonising transport: setting the challenge", U.K. Department for Transport, March 26, 2020).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Given the current trajectory of ultra-low emission vehicle sales, this timetable appears realistic, requiring only a modest amount of policy intervention to force the transition.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if ultra-low emission cars reach 50 per cent of all new registrations by 2031, their share of the total fleet will still be much lower because of the number of older vehicles still in use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But there is still likely to be a small, significant oil consumption by the end of the decade, becoming much larger and more significant by the end of the 2030s, given the turnover in the vehicle fleet.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Britain's oil consumption represents a very small and diminishing share of the world total, just 1.5 per cent, so the implied transition from petroleum to electric cars is too small to matter on a global scale.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the transition is likely typical for a range of other high-income countries in Europe, which will have a big impact in aggregate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;More important is whether the big three petroleum markets (China, the United States and India) see a similar shift towards electric vehicles over the next two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China is likely to electrify road transport at least as fast as Britain, given its limited domestic oil production and dependence on imports, which policymakers have identified as a top strategic vulnerability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Beijing has made the production and diffusion of electric vehicles a priority on both national security and environmental grounds to reduce oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The transition in the United States remains more uncertain, given the country's large domestic oil production and political disagreements over energy policy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Future Democratic administrations are likely to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles while future Republican administrations may offer less policy support.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, which is the smallest but fastest growing of the big three petroleum markets, seems more likely to follow China given its similar dependence on imported oil.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For petroleum producers, including OPEC, the international oil majors and U.S. shale firms, the transition to electric vehicles is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumption and prices in the next five years (2021-2025).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But the transition will emerge as a small but significant factor in petroleum markets over the five-to-10 year time frame (2026-2030) and a decisive factor in the following decade (2031-2040).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> BENGALURU, July 1 (Reuters) - Indian stocks eked out modest gains as they entered the second half of the year, helped by heavyweight financials, although worries over the impact on the economy from a persistent surge in coronavirus cases tempered investor sentiment.&#60;p&#62; The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.3% to 10,332.9 by 0527 GMT on Wednesday, while the benchmark S&#38;P BSE Sensex was up 0.4% at 35,055.94, after recording their best quarter in 11 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Post the initial pick up in the market seen after the economy reopened, it is going to remain in a range as pent up demand looks set to run out, said Neeraj Dewan, director at Quantum Securities in New Delhi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For now, global liquidity is helping the market ... but all indications are that the economy will take longer than anticipated to recover.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday warned citizens against flouting rules to prevent the spread of the virus, as he extended a scheme providing free food grains to 800 million Indians, at a cost of around $12 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Coronavirus cases in India jumped by more than 18,000 to 585,493 as of Wednesday morning, including 17,400 deaths, according to federal health ministry data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The stock market has recovered sharply from multi-year lows hit in mid-March on virus fears, but the benchmark indexes are still down around 15% for the year, having already suffered earlier in the year from a weak economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Meanwhile, broader Asian stocks struggled for traction as better-than-expected Chinese factory activity could not soothe worries that a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States could hinder an economic recovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In Mumbai on Wednesday, lenders HDFC Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd were among the top boosts to the Nifty, rising as much as 2.2% and 2.6%, respectively, while agro-chemical maker UPL Ltd was the top percentage gainer with a jump of 3.4%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Telecom operator Bharti Airtel rose as much as 2.7% after Carlyle said it will buy a 25% stake in Bharti's data centre arm for $235 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd dropped 3.8% to its lowest since end-May after reporting a loss for the March quarter.

            <title>Can India be the next Solar Manufacturing hub?</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/energy-speak/can-india-be-the-next-solar-manufacturing-hub/4359</link>
            <description> Indias solar dream under a cloud as domestic players face survival issues due to policy hurdles&#60;p&#62;COVID-19s impact on our lives and economy has been earth shattering. The lockdowns and restrictions have sent the global supply chain in a disarray and have halted industrial growth. Besides focusing on the importance of sustainability and the need for disease protection protocols, COVID-19 has brought to the fore the importance of building domestic manufacturing facilities risks associated with over dependence on imports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The present scenario perfectly reflects the Government of Indias bold and decisive initiatives to make India a manufacturing hub and claim the export market, while satisfying the in-house requirements. Initiatives like Make in India, the introduction of SEZs, increasing export incentives, launching phased manufacturing programme (PMP) and Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme have helped India grow into a lucrative market for investment and progress. Indias best chance for a phenomenal revival is also within one of these initiatives.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Indian manufacturing sector has the potential to become a $1 trillion industry by 2025, thus powering industrial and technological growth, creating jobs, claiming export markets, generating revenue and bringing in socio-economic growth. SEZs play a major role in the growth of the manufacturing industry. They provide direct employment to more than 25 lakh people and have attracted an investment of more than Rs 5.50 lakh crore, contributing one-third of the total national exports (Rs 7.87 lakh crore).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is important to note that Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in India were built to enhance the industrial capacity of the country and to build something great that will lead the country out of darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At this juncture, India has already deployed 87 GW RE projects whereas 64 GW additional capacity lies under varying stages of bidding or installation. These figures need to be viewed against the target of having 175 GW installed by 2022.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is where the situation stood when the coronavirus outbreak turned things on their head by disrupting global supply chains. The current crossroads offer an excellent opportunity for the Centre in rejigging past plans for making India self-sufficient in the manufacture of solar cells and modules, batteries and ancillary equipment, which includes wind power. In this way, India will curb its import dependency and save tremendous foreign exchange.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Significantly, in an address to the nation on 12th May, the PM had issued a clarion call: Vocal for local. The PM emphasised the importance of a new self-reliant India  Atma Nirbhar Bharat. In the case of renewables, this is only possible by ensuring an enabling environment for domestic manufacturers in solar power, which is presently lacking. Some elaboration is needed on specific issues hurting the solar industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On 30th July 2018, going by the recommendations of the Director General of Trade Remedies, the Union Ministry of Finance imposed a 25 per cent Safeguard Duty (SGD) on the imports of solar cells/modules for two years. Moreover, this was lowered in a phased manner. While the duty was 25 per cent for a year, it was 20 per cent for the next six months and for the remaining tenure ending July 2020 it stands at 15 per cent. The import levy was meant to protect local manufacturers from the losses inflicted by cheap, substandard imports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With the two years about to end, the Centre is likely to replace SGD with Basic Custom Duty (BCD) on solar cells and assembled modules/panels. Despite being well intentioned, such a move will badly impact domestic solar manufacturers located in Special Economic Zones (SEZ). In case BCD is levied, manufacturing units located to SEZs will get adversely affected as compared to their counterparts in DTA as manufacturing units located in SEZ which would be liable to pay BCD on value addition. However, a manufacturing facility located in DTA wont be liable to pay BCD on value addition done in DTA.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Approximately 63 per cent of cell manufacturing units (2 GW of the 3.1 GW capacity) and 43 per cent of module making plants (3.8 GW of the 9 GW capacity) are located in SEZs (Special Economic Zones). Therefore, imposing Basic Customs Duty (BCD) will end up severely hurting all SEZ units unlike those located in DTAs (Domestic Tariff Areas). It is thus essential to put SEZ units manufacturing PV cells and modules at par with DTA units for the purpose of levy of custom duties otherwise these units will die an unnatural death and thousands of people will have to lose their jobs&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What needs to be done to make India self-reliant in the renewable energy space?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Against the COVID-19 backdrop, as India seeks to supplant global supply chains with domestic ones for renewables, imposing BCD without putting SEZ units manufacturing PV cells and modules at par with DTA units for the purpose of levy of Basic Custom Duty otherwise these units will die an unnatural death and thousands of people will have to lose their jobs. Irrespective of unit location, it is time to implement a well-thought-out solar manufacturing roadmap providing a level-playing field for all domestic manufacturers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The imposition of custom duties is a short-term policy instrument to protect the industry. However, the need of the hour is a comprehensive solar manufacturing policy, which clearly defines the incentives available for entities willing to invest in manufacturing in India. MNRE, which is the nodal ministry for solar manufacturing, floated Draft Solar Manufacturing Policy in December 2017. However, there has been no development on this front since then. The industry would benefit immensely if the government took the cue from Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and provides incentives such as upfront 25 per cent Central Financial assistance on capital expenditure, interest subvention and export incentives for solar module and cell manufacturing. As it will help us to capture the opportunity created by realignment of supply chains once we pass this pandemic. This will help India to achieve its RE targets and to achieve its Make in India mandate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETEnergyworld.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

            <description> It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing&#60;p&#62;NEW DELHI: Electric vehicles market in India may experience a shift as consumers seek affordable products amid COVID-19, and it could make manufacturers resume production for conventional vehicles, according to a report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report - Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities in India's Energy and Mobility Sectors - is prepared by government think tank Niti Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Auto sales could decrease by as much as 45 per cent in the financial year 202021. EV production could be affected in the short term due to lower demand and supply-chain disruptions with BNEF estimating an 18 per cent decrease in global EV sales in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The EV market may experience other shifts. For example, there is an expectation of demand for more affordable EV products. This potential shift in consumer preferences may affect manufacturers' investment and production decisions. Ultimately, resuming production levels for conventional vehicles and EVs will depend on demand revival, supply-chain reactivation, and access to the labour force," the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Lower disposable incomes and a tendency towards cash saving will lead to reduced demand for EV in the short term, the report said, adding "some OEMs' customers are pushing back their EV business plans by two or more years".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On the impact on EV supply chains, the report said, "There may be delays in EV production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles. Curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report also highlighted the consequences of policy changes stating "many state EV policies and e-bus projects may be delayed due to other priorities and social-distancing challenges".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stressing that the emerging situation and challenges in the context of COVID-19 has and will continue to disrupt business as usual in the mobility sector, the report said the impact of the pandemic on passenger and freight segments, as well as the auto industry, raise several questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These include whether the overall demand for mobility will fall in the short to medium-term, will ridership of public and shared transport modes decline and will private modes be preferred?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also pondered whether lack of auto sales will cause a severe hit to the supply chain and a growing call for self-sufficiency lead to a push to create local supply chains.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Will the Prime Minister's call for domestic manufacturing and localisation attract investments at a time when a recession is looming? Would the new mobility ecosystem propelled by startups be able to survive the crisis," it wondered.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>India has to be data sovereign country, apps should adhere to data integrity: NITI Aayog CEO</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/headlines/1111725-india-has-to-be-data-sovereign-country-apps-should-adhere-to-data-integrity-niti-aayog-ceo</link>
            <description> A day after the Centre banned 59 mobile apps with China links, NITI Aayog CEO&#60;p&#62;Amitabh Kant said that any apps released in the country must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty, and transparency and stressed that the country has to stay "data sovereign".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty, and transparency. They must be transparent in origin and final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action is taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet. Amid the ongoing border tensions with China in Eastern Ladakh, the Centre had on Monday banned 59 mobile apps including Tik Tok, UC Browser, and other Chinese apps "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity and defense" of the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A senior official at the IT Ministry said the prime reason to block the apps under section 69 A of the Information Technology Act is to stop the violation and threat to the security of the state and public order and to plug the data leaks. "Almost all of them have some preferential Chinese interest. Few are from countries like Singapore. However, the majority have parent companies which are Chinese," the official said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure the safety and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace, Ministry of Information Technology said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>European Commission Changes EU Steel Import Quotas System</title>
            <link>https://steelguru.com/steel/european-commission-changes-eu-steel-import-quotas-system/560775</link>
            <description> The European Commission has published the result of its second investigation reviewing the safeguard measures put in place by the European Union on imports of steel products.&#60;p&#62;The thorough package, that will take effect as of 1 July, applies all available legal means to defend the European steel industry in the current difficult market situation. The changes take account of the special circumstances prevailing in the market due to the coronavirus crisis as well as expected developments. They will ensure that the gradual resumption of activity and return to normality takes place in an orderly manner. The adjustments made in managing the quotas will be effective in deterring potentially harmful stockpiling behaviour by any foreign exporters that may try to sell very high amounts of steel in the EU market in an opportunistic manner to the detriment of the EU steel industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The adjustments strike an appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of all the interested parties within the EU. They can shield the EU steel industry from the eventual effects of trade diversion in a way that is most adapted to the current circumstances, while ensuring sufficient supply for the steel-using industries in Europe. Since the launch of the review in February 2020, the Commission has considered 300 submissions received from stakeholders, consulted EU Member States and received their wide support on the proposed changes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;More specifically, the main changes are the following:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Country-specific quotas will be made available in quarterly and not annual allotments. This will help ensure a more stable flow of imports at this stage and will minimise the risk of short-term import surges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A new country-specific quota will be introduced for hot-rolled flat (category 1) steel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Access to the residual quota for countries that have previously exhausted their country-specific quota will be only permitted to the extent necessary to respond to demand. This will help ensure equitable access to the EU market for smaller exporting countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The list of developing countries excluded from the measures is now updated on the basis of the most recent stable statistical data (2019).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The measures remain fully in line with the EU's international commitments, and as provided for by the applicable WTO rules, the affected non-EU countries were consulted earlier this month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Commission introduced the initial safeguard measures on steel imports in July 2018. The measures aim to prevent economic damage for European steel producers, given the risk of import increases related to the introduction of trade restrictions by the US on steel and aluminum products. The Commission confirmed the initial temporary measures in early 2019 for a period until end of June 2021. The first review taking account of the market evolution was concluded in September 2019. The adjustments announced today result from the second review initiated in February 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Clean Energy Can Support Indias Economic Recovery post-Covid-19</title>
            <link>https://udaipurkiran.com/clean-energy-can-support-indias-economic-recovery-post-covid-19/</link>
            <description> New report highlights emerging challenges and opportunities for Indias transition to clean mobility and power systems in the context of Covid-19&#60;p&#62;NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) today released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities for Indias Energy and Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the countrys leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for Indias transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that Indias economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indias strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the countrys growth rate ahead of peers, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Clean energy will be a major driver of Indias economic recovery and international competitiveness, added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhousesthe transport and power sectorsand emerge stronger.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support Indias clean energy future: 1) invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2) support resilient and secure energy systems, 3) prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4) promote social and environmental equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to Indias public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India, said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyones lives, said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report states that Indias transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report can be accessed on the following links:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;NITI Aayog: https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-06/India_Green_Stimulus_Report_NITI_VF_June_29.pdf&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rocky Mountain Institute: https://rmi.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;RMI India: https://rmi-india.org/insight/india-stimulus-strategy-recommendations-towards-a-clean-energy-economy/&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://udaipurkiran.com/shri-dharmendra-pradhan-chairs-a-webinar-to-discuss-ways-to-enhance-steel-usage/</link>
            <description> Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Steel and Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas today chaireda webinar on  IspatiIrada : Enhancing steel usage with focus&#60;p&#62;on construction and infrastructure sectors. Minister of State for Steel Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Secretary, Steel, Senior officers from the Ministry of Steel, subject experts, industry leaders, academicians, researchers, large users and regulatorsalso participated in the webinar.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that the steel industry plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a nation. He said that India has become second largest producer of steel in the world, and has the capacity to build quality products, but per-capita consumption of steel in the country is almost one-third of the global average, and there is immense potential upside to it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Talking about the IspatiIrada, theMinister said, Ispat is not just a material but it is a state of mind. India has an IspatiIrada to be an inclusive developed nation.He said that it is not a mere slogan, but a manifestation of the Governments determination to strengthen the economy, ameliorate the condition of the poor, improve environment and enhance employment opportunities. He further stated that the collaborative branding campaign IspatiIrada has the objective of promoting appropriate steel usage in the country,and aims to leverage usage of steel as an easy-to-use, environment-friendly, cost-effective, affordable and strength-giving material.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Minister said that we have to identify the opportunities and challenges in, increasing steel consumption. He said that Ministry of Steel has already discussed with key infrastructure ministries about more steel usage, and is engaging with various departments, state governments and other stakeholders. He called for Make in Steel through a transition to more steel intensive construction. India is investing big time in creating infrastructure for future across sectors like railways, roads, civil aviation, energy, which will further provide impetus to the steel consumption in the country. He informed that a working group will be set up which will regularly monitor the steps being taken to enhance the steel usage. He asked the Webinar participants to come with a few solid recommendations, which would be implemented.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In his address, Shri Kulaste said that there is wide scope of increasing the consumption of steel in the country, particularly in the rural areas. The Consumption of steel in the rural areas is almost one-quarter of the national average. He said that the increase in steel consumption will give impetus to the economic activities, help in improving the environment, and provide employment opportunities. He said that the Government has announced National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs. 103 lakh crore in the infrastructure sector, and this will lead to enhanced steel demand. Ministry of Steel is already in talks with other departments to increase steel usage. Quoting the example of Japan, which is earthquake-prone and uses upto 80% steel in its structures, Shri Kulaste said that the Steel provides strength and stability to them. He also said the steel industry will have to find ways to reduce the cost of construction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Cool SiC 62 mm module opens up new applications for silicon carbide</title>
            <link>https://www.eletimes.com/cool-sic-62-mm-module-opens-up-new-applications-for-silicon-carbide</link>
            <description> Infineon Technologies AG (FSE: IFX / OTCQX: IFNNY) adds another industry standard package to its CoolSiC MOSFET 1200 V module family. The proven 62 mm device has been designed in half-bridge topology and is based on the trench chip technology. It opens up silicon carbide for applications in the medium power range starting at 250 kW  where silicon reaches the limits of power density with IGBT technology. Compared to a 62 mm IGBT module, the list of applications now additionally includes solar, server, energy storage, EV charger, traction, commercial induction cooking and power conversion systems.&#60;p&#62;The 62 mm module features Infineons CoolSiC MOSFETs, which enable a high current density. Very low switching and conducting losses minimize cooling efforts, whereas operating the device at high switching frequency allows for using smaller magnetic components. By implementing Infineons CoolSiC chip technology, it is possible to design smaller inverter designs for the application in terms of size, overall system costs can be reduced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With a base plate and screw connections, the housing is characterized by a very robust mechanical design, which is optimized for highest system availability, a minimum of service cost and off-time losses. The outstanding reliability is made possible by high thermal cycling capability and a continuous operating temperature (T ) of 150&#194;&#176;C. The symmetrical internal design of the housing allows identical switching conditions for the upper and lower switch. As an option, the thermal performance of the module can be improved even further with pre-applied thermal interface Material (TIM).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Availability&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Sensex, Nifty tick up but virus fears linger</title>
            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/sensex-nifty-edge-higher-even-041903039.html</link>
            <description> MoreBy Chris Thomas&#60;p&#62;BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks eked out modest gains as they entered the second half of the year, helped by heavyweight financials, although worries over the impact on the economy from a persistent surge in coronavirus cases tempered investor sentiment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.3% to 10,332.9 by 0527 GMT on Wednesday, while the benchmark S&#38;P BSE Sensex was up 0.4% at 35,055.94, after recording their best quarter in 11 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Post the initial pick up in the market seen after the economy reopened, it is going to remain in a range as pent up demand looks set to run out," said Neeraj Dewan, director at Quantum Securities in New Delhi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"For now, global liquidity is helping the market... but all indications are that the economy will take longer than anticipated to recover."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday warned citizens against flouting rules to prevent the spread of the virus, as he extended a scheme providing free food grains to 800 million Indians, at a cost of around $12 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coronavirus cases in India jumped by more than 18,000 to 585,493 as of Wednesday morning, including 17,400 deaths, according to federal health ministry data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The stock market has recovered sharply from multi-year lows hit in mid-March on virus fears, but the benchmark indexes are still down around 15% for the year, having already suffered earlier in the year from a weak economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, broader Asian stocks struggled for traction as better-than-expected Chinese factory activity could not soothe worries that a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States could hinder an economic recovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In Mumbai on Wednesday, lenders HDFC Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd were among the top boosts to the Nifty, rising as much as 2.2% and 2.6%, respectively, while agro-chemical maker UPL Ltd was the top percentage gainer with a jump of 3.4%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Telecom operator Bharti Airtel rose as much as 2.7% after Carlyle said it will buy a 25% stake in Bharti's data centre arm for $235 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd dropped 3.8% to its lowest since end-May after reporting a loss for the March quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Shailesh Kuber)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Prototypes of Three New Indigenous Fighters To Be Ready In Next Four Years. Here Are The Details</title>
            <link>http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2020/07/prototypes-of-three-new-indigenous.html</link>
            <description> Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Indias public-sector aerospace giant, is currently working on three indigenous fighter jets  TEJAS Mk2, Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter derived from the naval version of the TEJAS, and the fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).&#60;p&#62;Chairman and Managing Director of HAL, R Madhavan, has said that the prototypes of the three fighters will be ready in the next four years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So first the TEJAS Mk2 will come out, and then the TEDBF and then AMCA. Prototypes of all three will be out within 3-4 years, Madhavan said in the interview, adding that HAL was looking at a seven to eight year time-frame for each of these aircraft getting airborne.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Contrary to what its name suggests, TEJAS-Mk2, a significantly modified version of TEJAS-Mk1, will actually be a medium-weight fighter aircraft.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Among other changes, the GE F404 engine in TEJAS Mk1 will be replaced with the more powerful F414 turbofan, and canards will be added behind the cockpit. While the new F414 turbofan engine will provide the fighter more thrust, canards will improve its manoeuvrability significantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a result of the modifications being made by the Aeronautical Development Agency, the Mk2 variant will have higher payload capacities, giving it more weapon delivery options, and will carry more fuel, which will increase its range.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IAF may induct 12 TEJAS Mk2 squadrons (around 200 aircraft).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TEJAS-Mk1 is already in squadron service with the Indian Air Force (IAF). The second TEJAS squadron, Number 18 Squadron Flying Bullets, was operationalised in May. The first TEJASs were inducted into Number 45 Squadron Flying Daggers in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;16 TEJASs of the first order of 40 have been delivered to the IAF and a new order of 83 Mk.1A fighters is likely to be signed with HAL by the end of this year. HAL has improved the rate of production  a second assembly line has been set up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our target rate is 16 [TEJAS fighters] per year, for which a second line has already been set up now. We can easily ramp up to 16-20 per year as and when we receive the 83 TEJAS order, Madhavan has been quoted as saying.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TEDBF will be derived from the naval version of the TEJAS developed as a technology demonstrator.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The naval variant of the TEJAS has undergone a series of tests, including a series of arrested landings on the deck of aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in January this year to demonstrate the capability of its landing gear among other things.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier, ADA was to develop a new version of the naval TEJAS.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, due to design limitations, which were further complicated by the need for a heavy landing gear to bring a high-speed aircraft to a stop on the deck of the aircraft, the Navy and ADA were forced to ditch the plan.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A twin-engine fighter, which will have increased fuel and weapons carrying capability, is being developed now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The single engine TEJAS is not the aircraft for the navy. It cannot meet the requirements. What the navy needs is a twin-engine aircraft, because then only it can carry armaments, because the landing gear itself is quite heavy. So a Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter is what were looking at for the navy, Madhavan said, adding that the ADA has started the project, and this month they have got the clearance, and they are expecting it to be in service in 6-7 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The experience gained from the development and testing of the TEJASs naval variant and the designing of AMCA will feed into the TEDBF program, although the fighter will not have stealth features like the latter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The experience gained from the development and testing of the TEJASs naval variant and the designing of AMCA will feed into the TEDBF program, although the fighter will not have stealth features like the latter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ADA, reports say, is studying at least 3 variations of the design of the fighter. Its still unclear whether the new fighter will be a tail-less delta platform, similar to the IAF's TEJAS fighter or, for that matter, feature canards, a small forewing placed ahead of the main wing of the aircraft to aid manoeuvrability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;AMCA, Indias fifth-generation stealth fighter, is no new news. It has been in development for some years now, and latest reports say that the fighter jet will be built in partnership with a private player.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Madhavan has said that HAL and DRDO are looking to form a joint venture with a private-sector firm to execute this project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HAL and ADA are together in the design of AMCA. We are also looking at productionisation already  we want to create a special vehicle, a joint venture between HAL, DRDO and a private partner, he has been quoted as saying.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to a news report, the process of finding the private sector partner is all set to being and includes Larsen &#38; Toubro, Lakshmi Machine Works Advanced Technology Centre, TATA Advanced Systems and at least three defence firms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Workshare, financials and other terms of reference are to be drawn up this year ahead of the decision on the private sector company, the report says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T achieves milestone in manufacturing cryostat for Global Fusion Project</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111710-lt-achieves-milestone-in-manufacturing-cryostat-for-global-fusion-project</link>
            <description> Hazira (Gujarat) [India], June 30 (ANI: The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of&#60;p&#62;cryostat -- the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world. "This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India initiative," the company said in a statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is among the seven elite countries funding the 20 billion dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme at Cadarache in France. This is one of the world's largest research project that seeks to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power. "Today, in Hazira, we celebrate with you the completion of fabrication of all the segments of cryostat, including most recently the segments of the cryostat lid -- again achieved under these challenging conditions," said ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot. L&#38;T's CEO and Managing Director S N Subrahmanyan said the company used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This will further pave a way for the installation of cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power." Subrahmanyan said the initiative has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The cryostat assembly referred to as the top lid weighing 650 metric tonnes will be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER in a reactor pit in southern France. L&#38;T has already delivered the base section, the lower cylinder and the upper cylinder for the cryostat. The cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T's heavy engineering business won the prestigious contract in 2012. ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, is the overall in-charge of the Indian participation for this ambitious mega scientific project.

            <description> "The new coronavirus epidemic has brought great challenges to Byton's financing and production operations," Byton said in a statement.&#60;p&#62; SHANGHAI: China-based electric car startup Byton said on Tuesday it will suspend production from July 1 to conduct a reorganization of the firm after being hit by the coronavirus pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, said it was also actively raising funds to address issues relating to unpaid staff salaries and that it hoped to start paying employees from July.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The new coronavirus epidemic has brought great challenges to Byton 's financing and production operations," it said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "After careful consideration and joint consultations with our shareholders and management, we have decided to, from July 1, kickstart a plan to lower employee costs and promote the company's strategic reorganization," it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Byton produces all of its vehicles at a plant in Nanjing. From Wednesday it will suspend most operations in China, where its activities include research and development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company is among a series of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturing startups that have emerged in recent years to challenge foreign companies like Tesla Inc. China, which has been eager to curb smog and spur its own auto industry, has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) to account for 25% of auto sales by 2025, up from around 5% currently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But appetite to fund such startups began falling last year and has been dealt a further, heavy blow by the coronavirus pandemic, leaving a number fighting to survive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In May, sales of NEVs fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, China's largest auto industry association said. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In April, industry website Electrek reported that Byton had put hundreds of employees from its Santa Clara facility in California on furlough.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Byton was launched in September 2017 by Future Mobility Corp, a company co-founded by former BMW and Nissan Motor executives, and also has software and design facilities in the United States and Germany.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also Read:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Electric cars are about to start rolling out of the Arizona desert&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/mahindra-launch-three-electric-vehicles-051500890.html</link>
            <description> Mahindra is expected to launch at least three electric vehicles by the end of the current fiscal year. The company has had great success with the current crop of electric three-wheelers sold in the Indian market.&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the latest reports from, the company plans to expand its range of electric vehicles in the near future. Mahindra plans to launch the Atom electric and the Treo Zor as the demand for commercial electric vehicle continues to grow in the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Alongside the two commercial oriented EVs, the company is also working on introducing the eKUV100 which has been in the pipeline for a long time. Once it arrives, it is expected to be the cheapest electric car sold in the Indian market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mahindra Electric reported that it sold over 14,000 EVs last year, mostly coming from the Tero electric autorickshaws. Despite the ongoing challenging times and production disruptions in the auto sector, the company plans to stay focussed on the electric vehicles segment. The reports also suggest that due to the increased demand for Treo, it has encouraged the company to fast-track the launch process for the Tero Zor as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Story continues&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company has confirmed that it will be working on launching electric vehicles for commercial use alongside mainstream vehicles such as the eKUV100. It reports that the timelines for primary electric vehicles will not be affected due to the increased focus on the commercial segment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on this Pawan Goenka, MD and CEO, Mahindra and Mahindra had said, "Scale for EVs is very important and we would be subscale if we do everything on our own. To get larger volumes and reduce costs we need strategic investments. It is too early to talk about an IPO, we need to first work on profitability and bring down our stake."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Mahesh Babu, MD and CEO of Mahindra Electric, has recently stated that the company has had a great Q4 in the last financial year and reported positive in EBITDA. The company is not looking to sell any of its stakes and is currently looking to increase the investment.View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also stated that the company is looking for PE co-investors who will be a partner to the company, but Mahindra Group will continue to be the majority stakeholder in the company. Mr Babu further stated that the company is looking to set up a new global R&#38;D centre shortly as well.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;View photos&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thoughts About The Mahindra To Launch Three Electric Vehicles In Current Financial Year&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mahindra Electric reported that the current challenges in the import of some of the components from China owing to the ongoing tensions between the two countries is temporary. The electric vehicle industry of India will be restored soon as the demand is growing at a rapid rate. As a result, we can expect the upcoming electric vehicles to launch soon in the Indian market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>2 deals, 2 CBI cases: How banks flouted rules while lending to Videocons Venugopal Dhoot</title>
            <link>https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/2-deals-2-cbi-cases-how-banks-flouted-rules-while-lending-to-videocons-venugopal-dhoot-5490121.html</link>
            <description> Videocons loan dealings with banks expose how easily banks could flout norms when approached by a powerful industrialist and raises more questions on the efficacy of safeguards banks and regulators follow to avert corruption in high value loan deals.&#60;p&#62;On June 23, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against Videocon boss Venugopal Dhoot and unknown officials from a consortium of lenders led byState Bank of India (SBI)for alleged irregularities in extending loans. The lenders colluded with Videocon Mozambique Rovuma 1 Limited (VMRL), a subsidiary of Videocon Hydrocarbon Holdings Limited (VHHL), in helping the company make wrongful gains, CBI said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is the second instance since 2008 that Dhoot, a businessman whose company primarily makes and distributes consumer electronics and home appliances in India, has found himself in the crosshairs of an investigation for alleged bank fraud. The first one  an alleged quid pro quo deal with formerICICI Bankhead Chanda Kochhar  made headlines not long ago.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The common thread in these  several  high-profile cases of corruption that have come to light in recent years has been suspect bank loans. Former liquor baron Vijay Mallya, fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are accused by investigating agencies of gaming the system and defrauding banks of millions of dollars.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Close&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As it happened in those cases, bankers are again under the scanner. The Videocon Mozambique case is based on a preliminary inquiry against officials of the consortium of banks (SBI, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank) and the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Apart from its mainstay business, Videocon also has interests in the oil and gas business. VHHL, according to the companys website, is a Cayman Islands company formed in 2009. Videocon owns interests in various international oil and gas concessions in Mozambique, Brazil, Indonesia, and East Timor, the website said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The banks, CBI said, flouted rules and didnt follow due process while giving a loan to Dhoot, CMD of VHHL. Banks didnt take possession of the asset against which the loan was given. They also did not insist on the closure of an earlier loan from Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) that was repaid by Dhoot using their money.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When contacted, Dhoot said, I dont know about the case. I will have to see the details. SBI, Indias largest lender, is yet to respond to Moneycontrols email seeking comment on the CBI charges.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dhoot and Banks&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Banks, for reasons best known to them, were always happy to oblige Dhoot. The 68-year-old Dhoot, like Mallya, who is fighting extradition to India in the UK, received loans for diversified businesses including electronics to energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But, to borrow an analogy from the life of Mallya, the good times didnt last for Dhoot. Come 2010, things started going south for Videocon Group as its financial situation deteriorated. In 2018, lenders took Videocon to the National Company Law Tribunal but the damage was already done.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A series of ambitious business plans and mounting debts dragged the group deeper into a mess. Banks were left high and dry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Similar to Mallyas case, it wasnt just a financial hit for banks. Financial irregularities, quid pro quo deals and rule violations in high-value loans invited the CBIs attention. The Mozambique deal is the latest such case that the CBI suspects foul play.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Mozambique deal&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the heart of the matter is VMRL, a subsidiary of VHHL. In 2008, VHHL acquired a 10 percent "participating interest" in an oil and gas block in the Rovuma area of Mozambique from US-based Anadarko Petroleum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Around four years later, a standby letter of credit (SBLC) facility of $2,773.6 million, or around Rs 21,079 crore at current rupee dollar-value, was sanctioned to VHHL by an SBI-led consortium for the companys oil and gas assets in Mozambique, Brazil and Indonesia as well as the refinancing of existing facilities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Up to $1,103 million, or Rs 8,383 crore, of the SBLC facility was refinanced. This included an outstanding of $400 million, or Rs 3,040 crore, to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), London.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ten months later, Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL) told banks that the SCB loan had grown to $530 million, or Rs 4,028 crore. The company asked the banks to pay off the loan and take over the oil and gas assets, CBI said. Banks, according to the CBI, did not question how the loan amount increased but paid the $530 million. They also did not take charge of the oil and gas assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ideally after the SCB payment, the banks should have taken over the gas and oil assets of VIL and the loan account of SCB closed. But that didnt happen. In other words, banks gave money without a collateral guarantee.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That is not all. Videocon continued to draw a loan from SCB even though VHHL was required to close the account after the loan was paid, CBI has observed. It is not clear how much additional amount Dhoots company borrowed from SCB.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Neither did Videocon inform the lenders about its continuing use of the SCB facility and nor did they ask any questions, CBI said. Though the SBI-led consortium didnt take charge of the Mozambique assets, they did take over Indonesia and Brazil assets in November 2013.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Later, ONGC Videsh Limited and Oil India Limited acquired Dhoots 10 percent stake in the Rovuma assets in Mozambique for $2.5 billion in January 2014.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to CBI investigators, ONGC needed a no-objection certificate from the lending banks before making payments for the Mozambique assets. VIL asked the consortium to pay off SCB London from the sale proceeds even though the loan had been paid off earlier, according to the CBI.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The consortium agreed to clear SCBs dues, subject to a cap of $650 million, but ended up paying $704.45 million, from the sale proceeds in connivance with bank officers, the CBI has said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What did VIL do? It spent only a part of the money availed from banks on oil assets abroad, according to CBI investigators. The rest of the funds was diverted, they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dhoot and the lenders were acting in unison, according to the CBI investigation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ICICI-Videocon case&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides the Mozambique deal, Dhoot also happens to be a key figure in a case involving ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar and Videocon. This case is also under the gaze of CBI.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In 2008, Dhoot floated an equal joint venture NuPower Renewables with Deepak Kochhar, the husband of Chanda Kochhar. He lent Rs 64 crore to the firm and later transferred the entire stake to Deepak Kochhar, according to the CBI.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In 2012, ICICI Bank loaned Rs 3,250 crore to the Videocon group companies as part of a Rs 40,000-crore consortium loan deal. The CBI says the two deals are connected.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The conflict of interest was brought to the notice of authorities by Arvind Gupta, a Delhi-based shareholder activist.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In 2016, Gupta wrote to the Prime Ministers Office, the Reserve Bank of India and other authorities pointing to suspicious financial transactions between ICICI Bank, the Kochhars and Dhoot.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The letter sought an investigation into illicit banking and commercial transactions involving Dhoot and the Kochhars, accusing them of wrongful personal gains.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As the investigation began, Kochhar was sent on leave in June 2018 and resigned four months later following an internal probe by the bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ICICI Bank, Dhoot and Kochhars firm have all denied wrongdoing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But there are several red flags in both cases that deserve a closer look. Take a look:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Mozambique case a) How did a consortium of banks led by SBI give a loan to a Videocon Group company to pay off an earlier debt without verifying and creating a charge against the loan? This question figures prominently in the CBI FIR.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A bank has to ensure that a loan is marked to a collateral to recover the money in the event of default. In Videocons case, the rule was overlooked, according to the CBI. As a matter of fact, banks do this (ignoring the rule) often. This is an adjustment between the lender and the borrower. This doesnt get noticed generally. Of course, it is a rule violation, said a Mumbai-based senior corporate banker on condition of anonymity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;b) The banks should have got the lien with SCB vacated when the loan was repaid but they didnt. Dhoot allowed VHHL to continue availing the facility from SCB, London. The decision to not create a charge on Mozambique assets, thereby causing wrongful gain to Videocon and wrongful loss to Indian PSU banks, smacked of dishonest intent, according to CBI.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ICICI-Kochhar case&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A banks top executives, especially those involved in credit decisions, have to disclose if their families have business dealings with a borrower group. This was not followed in the ICICI-Videocon deal.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is alleged that the loan given by ICICI Bank, which was then led by Chanda Kochhar, to the Videocon group was a quid pro quo for her husbands dealings with the business house.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Videocons loan dealings with banks expose how easily banks could flout norms when approached by a powerful industrialist and raises more questions on the efficacy of safeguards banks and regulators follow to avert corruption in high value loan deals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(With inputs from PTI)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The Andhra Pradesh (AP) government has decided to pull out of the power purchase agreements with the NTPC from its plants located at Kudigi Stage-1 in Karnataka and at Vallur in Tamil Nadu, which were entered into an agreement in 2010 and requested the Center to do the needful.&#60;p&#62;Citing poor plant load factors of these units  Kudgi recorded 21.586 per cent of PLF and Vallur, 45.822 per cent (as against the normative PLF of 85 per cent)  Andhra government said that these power plants are plunged into reserve shutdown for prolonged periods and if at all operating, maintaining technical minimum limits for most of the time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This dismal operational performance of the plants was causing the overall per unit cost of power (fixed and variable) surging to Rs 10/unit. This was causing Andhra DISCOMS unbearable financial burden, particularly, during this critical financial period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government also pointed out that as a result of the same, the DISCOMS were forced to purchase power from costly sources to substitute the expected generation from the two plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hence, the government was rescinding from the long-term PPAs to the extent of allocation issued by the Ministry of Power pertaining to NTPCs two plants, including the additional allocation under solar bundled power, a GO stated here on Monday, requesting the Centre to advise the NTPC accordingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is a Syndicate News-Feed; edited by Clean-Future Team&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Related&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;No Respite To Indian RE Developers From Financial Challenges&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Financial and project implementation troubles for Indian renewable energy (RE) developers do not seem to cease.

            <title>Tapping technology for a sustainable future - Opinion by Sanjeev Sharma</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/energy-speak/tapping-technology-for-post-covid-growth/4358</link>
            <description> "The transition to sustainable operations will come through emerging technologies and breakthrough innovations.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Sanjeev Sharma, ABB India&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;The current pandemic has presented the world with a chance to reset and rebuild in a more sustainable way, to inspire economic activity that creates value for us and the planet. Back in 2015, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN members under Agenda 2030 set the call for action through global partnership. Over the past five years, the campaign for sustainable action has gained momentum with different industries leading the charge in sustainable development. Specifically, the UN SDG- Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure emphasizes on Investment in infrastructure and innovation which are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Transition through Technology&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;As governments and industries across the world focus on creating an infrastructural base for rapid economic growth, it is important to ensure that this growth is powered through responsible energy consumption and a culture of sustainability. This transition to sustainable operations will come through emerging technologies and breakthrough innovations. In fact, even a small innovation can be a game-changer. For instance, electric motors account for roughly 28 percent of the worlds electricity consumption. There are roughly about 300 million of them in service today, and fitting every inefficient motor with variable speed drive would result in total global energy savings of 10 percent  which is equivalent to the output of 286 nuclear reactors. This is the true potential of technology.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Energy Efficiency as a Priority&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;One of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN is clean, affordable energy. Increased energy efficiency and a higher reliance on renewable energy resources will play a pivotal role in our journey towards a sustainable future. Given that only 33% of energy derived from natural resources is converted and utilized for end use applications, communities need to work closely to minimize energy loss and achieve better integration of renewable energy into day to day applications such as transport and manufacturing.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;For industries specifically, when the entire manufacturing process  from design to delivery  takes lesser time and consumes lesser energy, its a departure from convention. Successful restructuring of industry with the aim of increasing productivity and competitiveness, while introducing eco efficiency measures such as life cycle analysis, energy types of optimization, waste and resource minimization, and cradle to grave approaches on the widest scale possible within industries is critical. Add to this, the advantages of environment-friendly processes and substantial savings on operational costs, and you have the makings of a sustainable solution. Energy efficiency is potentially the most important and cost-effective means for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from industry there by addressing climate change mitigation as well. Sustainable energy solutions and new age power systems will lead to the transformation of industrial processes and usher in factories of the future where seamless energy efficiency is a core benefit.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;From applying smart solutions to a citys utilities by reducing water leakage and energy consumption, to using high-performance turbochargers in large diesel and gasoline engines in ships, power stations, generator sets, and other large vehicles to reduce fuel consumption, and using analytics to deliver industry-wide digital monitoring capabilities, these technologies are yielding increased efficiencies across sectors. For instance, a continuous monitoring system that can be installed across cement, steel, chemicals, and fertilizers companies, providing them with measurement and analytics of emissions to help them not only meet regulatory standards,but also improve productivity.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Additionally, heavy commercial vehicles used in underground mining are being equipped with an optimized e-drivetrain, which combines an electric motor, a high-power drive and a vehicle control unit to enable smooth and rapid transition from diesel to zero-emission electric operation.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;These technologies and innovations are opening up new pathways for economic, technical and logistical advantages across applications. Initial investments in clean energy and government support in the form of a more focused regulatory framework will help lay the foundation for superior carbon efficiency.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Resource Efficiency&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;As an industry, we want to grow aggressively, yet responsibly. If we draw a resource from nature, our objective should be to return to the planet as much as we take from it, if not more. Sustainability is about conservation of precious and scarce natural resources, water being a prime one among them. We at our plants have negligible water requirements for processes, nevertheless are focused on water conservation measures inhouse to protect this precious natural resource. While there is an increased effort to conserve water through preexisting initiatives such as rainwater harvesting and other conservation techniques, the need of the hour is to develop more efficient technology enabled solutions for industrial operations as well. For instance, solar powered water-pumping systems are a game changer in generating power to pump water, with the aim to conserve water while ensuring regular supply, as it already has in states like Telangana, MP, and Maharashtra. Similarly, the Surat Municipal Corporation has installed water flow-meters with digital functionality and is able to study consumption patterns, explore new strategies to improve water management and reduce non-revenue water loss.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Industry leaders need to commit to the development of next-generation products, services and digital solutions that contribute to global eco-efficiency for a carbon neutral system, whilst being at the forefront of the sustainability movement. In addition to industries, it is imperative that we foster a culture of innovation as a society and as a nation, and engage all stakeholders to jointly work towards a sustainable tomorrow."</description>

            <title>New projects fall over 50% in June as coronavirus lockdown takes hold</title>
            <link>https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/new-projects-fall-over-50-in-june-as-coronavirus-lockdown-takes-hold-120070100373_1.html</link>
            <description> Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy shows full effect of shutdown in June quarter&#60;p&#62;The lockdown which came into effect towards the end of March has caused new projects to plummet and existing projects to stop work, amid what is expected to be the worst year for the economy in decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New projects in the June quarter were at Rs 0.56 trillion, down 51.7 per cent compared to the same period in 2019, showed data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(CMIE). Completed projects were down 83.9 per cent to Rs 0.14 trillion (see chart 1).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Interestingly, the number of revived project showed an 82.8 per cent rise, while stalled projects also fell 23.1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Growth measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) was already seen to be at an 11-year low, before much of the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic had taken effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rating agency CRISIL had said that there is a recession ahead, which has happened only three times previously over the last 69 years (see chart 2). Poor monsoons affecting agriculture was the trigger each time, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The recession staring at us today is different. For one, agriculture could soften the blow this time by growing near its trend rate, assuming a normal monsoon. Two, the pandemic-induced lockdowns have affected most non-agriculture sectors. And three, the global disruption has upended whatever opportunities India had on the exports front, said the May 26 note.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has also been spending less on creating new assets (capital expenditure). It has instead focused on spending money on expenses like running its own operations or the payment of subsidies and salaries (revenue expenditure).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Capital expenditure, in fact, was allowed to contract by (-) 7.5%. In order to generate higher multiplier impact of an increase in government expenditure on growth, a sharper increase in government capital expenditure viz.-&#195;&#160;-viz. revenue expenditure is required during the course of the year. It is not only the size of the fiscal stimulus but also its composition in terms of low multiplier expenditures (revenue expenditures) viz.-&#195;&#160;-viz. high multiplier expenditures (capital expenditures), which matters, said D K Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India in his June 2020 Economy Watch report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;How soon the government extend support to revive core infra projects is anybodys guess, said the June 12 Engineering and Capital Goods sector report from brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities, authored by analysts Amit Mahawar, Swarnim Maheshwari, Ashutosh Mehta and Manish Agarwall.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report noted that companies which are involved in creating infrastructure projects are facing issues of labour and liquidity as work dries up. It noted that large players like Larsen &#38; Toubro, KEC International, Kalpataru Power Transmission are focusing on attracting and retaining contractual labour. They are also looking to increase their cash levels to tide over current challenges as payments from public sector companies and states have dried up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Read our full coverage on Consumer Sentiment Indicator&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The PIL has been filed by a 25-year-old resident of Jammu, Supriya Pandita The PIL argued that the national security threat invoked by the government to ban 59 Chinese apps should be applied uniformly&#60;p&#62;Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) signed with Chinese companies are the latest targets of the rising anti-China sentiment in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court has sought the cancellation of the $1 billion MoU signed by the Maharashtra state government with Chinas Great Wall Motors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The same plea also targets the $300 million MoU signed in 2017, between the Adani Group and the Chinas East Hope Group for manufacturing solar power equipment in Mundra SEZ.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The PIL has been filed by a 25-year-old resident of Jammu, Supriya Pandita.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The PIL has argued that doing business with Chinese when Indian soldiers were losing their lives at the border in skirmishes with that country, was against the will and sentiment of people of India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Taking note of the recent government decision to ban 59 Chinese apps, the PIL argued that while such measures were welcome, allowing MoUs to be signed with Chinese entities sends a wrong message to the people of India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The PIL argued that the national security threat invoked by the government to ban 59 Chinese apps should be applied uniformly, in ensuring a termination of MoUs with Chinese companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The PIL has alleged preferential treatment for select businesses and select states to enter into MuUs with Chinese entities and that entering into such MoUs ran contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modis call for Atmanirbhar Bharat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>New projects fall over 50% in June as coronavirus lockdown takes hold Poll</title>
            <link>https://smartinvestor.business-standard.com/market/Marketnews-647857-Marketnewsdet-New_projects_fall_over_50_in_June_as_coronavirus_lockdown_takes_hold.htm</link>
            <description> The lockdown which came into effect towards the end of March has caused new projects to plummet and existing projects to stop work, amid what is expected to be the worst year for the economy in decades.&#60;p&#62;New projects in the June quarter were at Rs 0.56 trillion, down 51.7 per cent compared to the same period in 2019, showed data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Completed projects were down 83.9 per cent to Rs 0.14 trillion (see chart 1).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Interestingly, the number of revived project showed an 82.8 per cent rise, while stalled projects also fell 23.1 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Growth measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) was already seen to be at an 11-year low, before much of the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic had taken effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rating agency CRISIL had said that there is a recession ahead, which has happened only three times previously over the last 69 years (see chart 2). Poor monsoons affecting agriculture was the trigger each time, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The recession staring at us today is different. For one, agriculture could soften the blow this time by growing near its trend rate, assuming a normal monsoon. Two, the pandemic-induced lockdowns have affected most non-agriculture sectors. And three, the global disruption has upended whatever opportunities India had on the exports front,"said the May 26 note.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has also been spending less on creating new assets (capital expenditure). It has instead focused on spending money on expenses like running its own operations or the payment of subsidies and salaries (revenue expenditure).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Capital expenditure, in fact, was allowed to contract by (-) 7.5%. In order to generate higher multiplier impact of an increase in government expenditure on growth, a sharper increase in government capital expenditure viz.-&#195;&#160;-viz. revenue expenditure is required during the course of the year. It is not only the size of the fiscal stimulus but also its composition in terms of low multiplier expenditures (revenue expenditures) viz.-&#195;&#160;-viz. high multiplier expenditures (capital expenditures), which matters,"said D K Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India in his June 2020 Economy Watch report.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;How soon the government extend support to revive core infra projects is anybodys guess,"said the June 12 Engineering and Capital Goods sector report from brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities, authored by analysts Amit Mahawar, Swarnim Maheshwari, Ashutosh Mehta and Manish Agarwall.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report noted that companies which are involved in creating infrastructure projects are facing issues of labour and liquidity as work dries up. It noted that large players like Larsen &#38; Toubro, KEC International, Kalpataru Power Transmission are focusing on attracting and retaining contractual labour. They are also looking to increase their cash levels to tide over current challenges as payments from public sector companies and states have dried up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> In a remarkable feat, Indian engineering and construction giant Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) completed the building of state-of-the-art cryostat for a $20 billion global nuclear fusion project which is presently being built in France, reports Financial Express.&#60;p&#62;The feat marks a milestone moment for the 'Make in India'as well. The final assembly or top lid sectors of the cryostat were built at the L&#38;T's manufacturing complex at Hazira in Gujarat's Surat district and was finally dispatched to France yesterday (30 June).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T had been awarded the contract to build and install the cryostat made of whopping 3,850 tonnes of steel back in 2012. The cryostat is the largest stainless-steel high-vacuum pressure chamber anywhere in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T's group chairman AM Naik has called it a moment of pride for India and the company. Meanwhile, the company has said in a statement that the development marks an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 650-tonne heavy cryostat assembly will be installed with other cryostat segments for ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in a reactor pit in southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Government Eases Restrictions on Pharma Ingredient Imports From China</title>
            <link>https://thewire.in/government/government-eases-restrictions-on-pharma-ingredient-imports-from-china</link>
            <description> This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at Indian ports.&#60;p&#62;New Delhi/Mumbai: Easing restrictions on imports from China, the customs department has decided to clear pharma raw material shipments from that country. Consignments of 11 top importers, including LG, Samsung, Toyota, Honda, and Siemens, will also be allowed entry, relieving them of the 100% inspection rule.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at Indian ports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After representations from industry bodies, the government on Tuesday cleared imports of active pharma ingredients (APIs) from China. Besides, the top importers falling within the Tier 3 category of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme were given exemption from stringent scrutiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Imports of APIs and shipments from AEO T3 importers have been exempt from the 100% check. The Indian pharma industry is heavily dependent on API imports from China and they were facing a huge shortage of raw material. Besides, the tier 3 AEOs are the top importers who meet the highest level of compliance, so they have been given the relaxation, said a government official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said these shipments would get moving from Wednesday. Over 60% of APIs used in India come from China. On June 22, Customs officials in Chennai and Vizag were asked to put all shipments from China on hold until further orders. This was done on the basis of intelligence inputs about illegal imports of narcotics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Informal instructions were given to all ports and airports to do 100% physical checks of shipments originating in China. Bilateral trade between China and India was worth $88 billion in FY19, with a deficit of $53.5 billion in Chinas favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is also heavily dependent on China for intermediates and key starting material (KSM) for making drugs. This dependence has grown over the years as local manufacturers have moved to high-margin products (after they could not expand freely due to pollution norms) and Chinese APIs are 30% cheaper than domestic stuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country mostly imports APIs and intermediates for vitamins (like Vitamin C), common antibiotics, and metformin (diabetes) from China. The government has now drawn up a plan to reduce dependence on the country by incentivising the local production of APIs through production-linked incentives (PLI) of up to Rs 10 crore. The government has identified 41 products (molecules), covering 53 crucial APIs, for which India is dependent on China. Almost 80% of the 41 are intermediates. In 2016, the Customs department had launched the Authorised Economic Operator, or AEO, scheme. It is a voluntary programme, under which an importer gets preferential treatment from Customs for being compliant with supply-chain security standards. AEOs get benefits like fast-tracking shipments, deferred payments, exemption from issuing guarantees, and preferential treatment from Customs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They are classified into three categories  T1, T2, and T3  with T3 representing the highest level of compliance. Of the more than 3,000 AEOs, only 11 are in the T3 category. Meanwhile, the government is planning to curtail imports of at least 300 non-essential items from China, either through duty hikes and imposing non-tariff barriers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;By arrangement with Business Standard.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>China to cut or suspend subsidy for substandard waste-to-energy power plants</title>
            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-cut-suspend-subsidy-substandard-061147292.html</link>
            <description> MoreBEIJING (Reuters) - China will cut or suspend subsidy for waste-to-energy (WTE) power plants that violate emission standards, as part of its anti-pollution campaign, the country's finance and environment ministries said late on Tuesday.&#60;p&#62;The move, effective July 1, aims at improving environmental levels at WTE power plants and mitigating public discontent with stench and the risk of toxic emissions, such as dioxin.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) had rolled out a new regulation last year, forcing waste incinerators to reveal real-time emission and temperature data to the public as well as to upload it to the environmental bureau monitoring system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government will cut or even suspend the subsidy for the WTE power generators that are found not revealing emission data or forging the data or not reaching the standards, according to the joint statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China has vowed to build waste incineration handling capacity of 591,400 tonnes per day by 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At end 2019, China had installed WTE power generation capacity of 12.02 gigawatts (GW) and daily incineration capacity of 490,000 tonnes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to China's Biomass Energy Association, the country is expected to add 2.9 GW WTE power generation capacity in 2020, requiring a subsidy of about 11.1 billion yuan ($1.57 billion).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Beijing has been striving to curtail financial supports to renewable power sources in order to ease a backlog of subsidy payment exceeding 223 billion yuan, which may shadow the development of WTE projects in the pipeline.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Reporting by Muyu Xu and David Stanway; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>'Forget doubling incomes, Farmers will be happy if incomes grow at all'</title>
            <link>https://www.sify.com/finance/forget-doubling-incomes-farmers-will-be-happy-if-incomes-grow-at-all-news-topnews-uhbg2Bicbicga.html</link>
            <description> Source: Sify Author: Shreehari Paliath, Indiaspend.org Last Updated: Wed, Jul 1st, 2020, 11:58:37hrs&#60;p&#62;Bengaluru: As India deals with growing numbers of COVID-19 cases and the economic ramifications of the resultant lockdowns, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has made a slew of announcements and promulgated ordinances to revive the economy, including the agriculture sector. It brought in the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion &#38; Facilitation) Ordinance 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020, and amended the Essential Commodities Act, all through ordinances.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indias economy is expected to contract by 4.5% in 2020-21 while the world economy is expected to contract by 4.9%, as per International Monetary Fund estimates. While India is experiencing a slowdown and its first non-agriculture recession, the growth of agricultural output has to be matched by rising demand, else the excess supply with declining demand will only drive prices down, says Himanshu, associate professor of economics at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Most of the announcements made by the Centre are part of the reforms ongoing for the last two decades, and marketing reforms alone will not provide remunerative prices for farmers if there is declining demand and depressed commodity prices, he tells us in this interview.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Agriculture sector will be the mainstay of Indias economy and agricultural growth is estimated to be 3%, Ramesh Chand, member of NITI Aayog, said at a press conference in April 2020. Although agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) may be positive, it may not mean an increase in farmers incomes. Forget doubling incomes, farmers will be happy if they maintain positive growth in incomes, said Himanshu.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Himanshu is a visiting fellow at Centre de Sciences Humaines, and has held visiting fellowships at London School of Economics, United Nations University-WIDER and GREQAM. He has been part of government committees including the expert group on measurement of poverty (Tendulkar Committee), National Statistical Commission and Ministry of Rural Development. In 2018, he published How Lives Change: Palanpur, India and Development Economics with Nicholas Stern and Peter Lanjouw.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He talks to us about the reforms announced by the government, the outlook for farm income growth, and decrease in rural demand as a fallout of COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Edited excerpts:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India has produced surplus food grains over the last two decades. Yet, farm incomes seem insufficient. How are the announcements made by the Centre going to change this reality?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Farm incomes depend on revenue earned by the farmer and the costs incurred. Surplus foodgrains do not automatically mean higher profits for farmers if the revenue they earn is less than the costs incurred. This can happen if the prices of output rise slower than the prices of inputs. Except for a brief period of five months last year, for the last two years output prices have been rising slowly or have declined. As a result, even though output has increased at 2% to 3%, it has not contributed to commensurate increase in incomes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Announcements made by the Centre are unlikely to lead to higher prices of output if the demand for agricultural commodities continues to remain low. With rising diesel prices, electricity charges and fertiliser prices, even if the farmers produce more, they can incur losses. The prices of agricultural commodities will rise if there is rise in demand for these commodities. [But] that depends on domestic as well as international demand, both of which have been declining for Indian farmers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This slowdown and recession in India will be the first non-agriculture recession. How do you see the agriculture sector perform in the current scenario, and is India on track to double farmers income by 2022 as promised?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The slowdown has been driven by declining demand. This has further strengthened after the lockdown and recession in the economy. While agriculture was less affected by lockdown, the growth of agricultural output has to be matched by rising demand. Otherwise, excess supply with declining demand will only drive prices down. Recent data on agricultural prices including milk and poultry suggests a sharp collapse in prices received by producers. With international prices also showing a declining trend, the downward pressure on agricultural prices is only going to intensify further.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Overall agricultural GDP may be positive but it does not necessarily mean an increase in income for farmers. Given the decline in economic activity in other sectors of the economy, it is likely that demand will decline severely. If that happens, an increase in agricultural output is unlikely to prevent farmers making losses in agriculture.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Forget doubling incomes, farmers will be happy if incomes grow at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While there have been announcements for long-term changes, farmers may not get remunerative prices unless there is demand for the produce. Under the present economic climate, what relief is--or must be--offered?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The only way demand can be revived is by increasing government spending, preferably in rural areas and for the poor who consume a larger share of their total consumption as agricultural produce including food. While this may take time, in the short-run, the government should procure as much as possible through MSP [minimum support price] operations [in] not just rice and wheat but also other crops such as pulses, oilseeds and other major crops. At the same time, there should be efforts to reduce input prices, particularly of diesel and fertilisers. The recent rise in fertiliser prices will only add to input costs, reducing the profit margin for farmers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has announced Rs 50,000 crore ($6.6 billion) for Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana to offer employment to reverse migrants in the 116 districts that have recorded the most migrants return. With the government announcing an additional Rs 40,000 crore ($5.3 billion) for MGNREGA, how different and beneficial do you think will the new scheme be to generate employment and revive rural demand?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Rs 50,000 crore for Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana is not additional spending. All of this was already budgeted in the budget of 2020-21. It has only been frontloaded. In terms of additional government spending, it has no impact. Further, some of these are infrastructural projects and will take time to get off the ground. How much of the Rs 50,000 crore is actually spent will depend a lot on the preparedness of state governments, which are struggling with finances and burdened with managing COVID-19 infections. Similarly, additional Rs 40,000 crore for MGNREGA is not sufficient given the large migration of workers back to rural areas. With all other avenues of employment declining, MGNREGA will have to do the heavy lifting of providing employment. The additional amount is barely sufficient to take care of employment generation at last years level, with increased wages. Most state governments have already spent a large part of their total allocation. For it to have any impact, large amounts upwards of Rs 100,000 crore [$13.2 billion] will be needed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;[Editors note: MGNREGA wages have been increased by Rs 20 with effect from April 1, 2020.]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has introduced an ordinance to create a national market for farm produce. Farmers are expected to receive remunerative prices from private players. What is your assessment and how does this impact or change MSP?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Most of the announcements are part of the reforms under way for the last two decades. Marketing reforms alone will not provide remunerative prices for farmers if there is declining demand and depressed commodity prices. The private sector is not going to incur losses to support farmers. It does not change anything as far as MSP is concerned, which incidentally is only implemented for rice and wheat. For all the fruits and vegetables that are generally traded in APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee], there is no MSP.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The success of private markets will also depend on the infrastructure made available for these markets. The cost of providing infrastructure has to come from the government.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There are millions of small and marginal farmers who are subsistence farmers, and need to cover the cost of taking the produce to the APMC and selling it to a private player. How will this be regulated and will it be essentially up to state governments to decide?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is a tricky issue. Agricultural marketing is a subject under the domain of state governments. It will depend on how state governments react. Reform does not mean that there are millions of private players waiting with billions of dollars to go and purchase from farmers. They are not going to do it if the cost of purchase is higher than the sale price. But even for the private players, they are not going to get the delivery of agricultural produce at their doorstep. Somebody will have to incur the cost of packaging, sorting, grading, transportation and storage. If not the farmer then private players, which also means that their cost of acquisition will be higher.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dispute redressal or arbitration will be a challenge for farmers, particularly the small and marginal farmers. Will contract farming, which is supposed to help farmers get a better price, make them dependent on the bureaucracy to resolve issues?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It will depend on the nature of contracts. It remains to be seen how many farmers opt for it; whether contracts are registered, and where. As of now, the government is yet to come up with model contracts, but even if it is implemented, the litigation costs are definitely going to be higher for farmers. It is unlikely that a small or marginal farmer will stand against a large corporation. There are so many questions that need to be worked out before this comes into effect. Remember, we are a country where almost all of agricultural (tenancy) contracts are oral with no legal guarantee. Most of these tenancy contracts are similar to contract farming. But the presence of tenancy laws has only encouraged both landlords and tenants to avoid the state rather than use the legal remedies available.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Cost of cultivation per unit of a crop varies state-wise. Often MSP is lower for crops other than paddy and wheat, which forces farmers into distress sale. Do the new announcements resolve this issue?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;No, the government does not even procure the 23 crops for which MSP is announced. Other than rice and wheat, there are procurements at a small scale for some pulses. But even for rice and wheat, there is large regional variation with more than three-fourth of total procurement contributed by three or four states. For example, for the current wheat harvest, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh accounted for 85% of all procurement with almost negligible [procurement] from Bihar, Jharkhand and other states. The new announcements will not resolve these issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government wants to create 10,000 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) in five years. What role do you see FPOs play in the current scenario?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;FPOs have been in operation for quite some time. In fact this scheme was launched during the United Progressive Alliance government. But it has failed to take off. Creating FPO requires cohesion among farmers and also some support from the government. While there has been negligible support from the government, it has also not materialised due to the existing structure of production in rural areas. Issues such as caste, tenancy, choice of crops [among other issues] require a different level of cooperation for the model to succeed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;( Paliath is an analyst at IndiaSpend.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Suzlon completes debt restructuring; promoters to infuse Rs 392 crore</title>
            <link>https://www.cnbctv18.com/energy/suzlon-debt-restructuring-6237891.htm</link>
            <description> Suzlon Energy announced the completion of its debt restructuring with the approval of secured lenders. The restructuring protected the Indian wind energy sector and saved thousands of jobs, Suzlon Founder Tulsi Tanti said.&#60;p&#62;Debt-laden wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon Energy today announced the completion of its debt restructuring with the unanimous approval of secured lenders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a statement released to the media, Suzlon said with the restructuring, its term debt would reduce substantially. The company said it would now pay interest of 9 percent per annum on its debt, repayable over 10 years starting July 1, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The remaining debt of secured lenders, Suzlon said would be replaced by 0.01 percent optionally convertible debenture (OCD) of the company and 0.0001% compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) of its subsidiary redeemable or convertible in 20 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The promoters would also be infusing Rs 392 crore as part of the restructuring.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Suzlon owes over Rs 12,906 crore to a consortium of 18 banks led by State Bank of India. The debt includes outstanding foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) of USD 172 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CNBC-TV18 had reported earlier that the SBI-led consortium of lenders had approved the debt restructuring plan in March this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This debt restructuring will ease the pressure on our cash flows significantly and give us headroom for ramping up business operations. We have reduced our fixed cost steeply and brought down the interest costs by more than 70 percent,"Suzlons Chief Financial Officer Swapnil Jain said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This has resulted in substantial reduction in the break-even point from pre-restructuring levels ensuring a long term sustainable business case, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Suzlon Founder and CMD Tulsi Tanti said, Consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India and the company have worked together to protect the interests of all the stakeholders involved, thereby protecting the Indian wind energy sector, saving thousands of direct and indirect jobs, ensuring the survival of large number of MSME vendors and protecting ~13 GW of operating wind energy assets of the nation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The renewable energy firm has battled a financial crisis before as well, and sold prized assets in the past to attempt to stabilise its position.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While the lenient terms of this debt restructuring will ease off the repayment pressure for the company, the stress has not entirely dissipated for Suzlon.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It posted a net loss of over Rs 740 crore in the December quarter of FY20 - its last reported number. Its net sales in the third quarter had also fallen 40 percent from the previous year to a little over Rs 650 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>E.ON &#38; thyssenkrupp Bring Hydrogen Production on the Electricity Market.</title>
            <link>https://www.newsonprojects.com/news/eon-thyssenkrupp-bring-hydrogen-production-on-the-electricity-market</link>
            <description> Print Published On: July 1 2020 Story Viewed 1 Times&#60;p&#62;E.ON and thyssenkrupp are making hydrogen technology more intelligent: large-scale electrolysis plants, which plant manufacturer thyssenkrupp offers to industry, can now be linked to the electricity market in Germany via E.ONs virtual power plant. This makes the plants electricity market ready. In this way, industrial hydrogen production can contribute to the efficient integration of green electricity into the energy system. The principle is that if there is a high demand in the power grid, the plant will shut down hydrogen production so that the energy required for electrolysis is available to the public power supply. Conversely, hydrogen production is ramped up if more energy is fed into the grid than can be distributed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This innovation makes so-called Power-to-X systems more attractive for the industry. The operator of a plant can market his willingness to adapt flexibly to general electricity demand and thus generate additional income on the electricity market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This process is automatically controlled by the E.ON Virtual Power Plant. This software platform links various mostly industrial producers and bulk purchasers of energy and controls the generation and consumption of these customers according to the current network load. In this way, the Virtual Power Plant makes a significant contribution to compensating for the fluctuating electricity production from renewable energy in the power grid.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;thyssenkrupp and E.ON successfully tested the system at the Carbon2Chem pilot plant with a capacity of up to two megawatts in Duisburg. E.ON has also checked that the plant meets all the requirements for participation in the balancing power market. Due to the high reaction speed of the thyssenkrupp plant, the technology can even participate in the market for high-quality primary control power. This was tested with the transmission system operator successfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;thyssenkrupp and E.ON are now cooperating on marketing. Effective immediately, thyssenkrupp is marketing the Power-to-X technology with the additional option of coupling the system to the virtual power plant. E.ON offers customers the option of operating the power plant optimized for the power market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;STEELGURU&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;AddThis Sharing Buttons&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Share to Facebook&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Facebook&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Share to Twitter&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Twitter&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Atlas Renewable Energy and Dow Inks Solar Energy PPA in Brazil</title>
            <link>https://www.energetica-india.net/news/atlas-renewable-energy-and-dow-inks-solar-energy-ppa-in-brazil</link>
            <description> Atlas Renewable Energy and Dow (NYSE: DOW) announced the signing of a large-scale solar energy contract in Brazil. The clean energy supply will be through the Jacaranda photovoltaic solar plant, located in Juazeiro, the State of Bah&#195;&#173;a, and is expected to supply over 440GWh per year that will mostly be used to serve Dow under a 15-year duration contract, with offtake starting in the first half of 2021.&#60;p&#62;The Jacaranda solar plant will have an installed capacity of 187MWp with more than 450,000 modules. The plant will generate enough energy to supply a sizable part of Dow's Aratu Site's energy needs. According to the average consumption of a Brazilian family, the amount of energy generated will be equivalent to supply enough power to a city of +750,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, the plant will avoid an approximate of 35,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year based on the GHG (Green House Gases) Protocol, methodology developed by the World Resources Institute which follows the methods used by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and it is aligned with Dow's Global Emissions Inventory. This amount of avoided CO2 emission could be compared to removing 36,800 vehicles from the streets of S&#195;&#163;o Paulo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This contract to secure renewable power capacity contributes to achieving one of Dow's 2025 Sustainability Goals, a commitment to obtain 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources by 2025. Dow also recently announced additional Carbon Reduction Goals, which aim to reduce Dow's net annual emissions by 15% from 2020 to 2030, representing a reduction of 5 million tons of CO2 in the next ten years and another significant step toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Currently, Dow is the number one user of clean energy in the chemical industry and among the top 25 global corporations for renewable power use (BNEF ranking), with contracts for wind, solar, hydro, biomass and landfill gas.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Jacarand&#195;&#161; solar plant will be developed, built and operated by Atlas Renewable Energy, whose track record and expertise in Latin America has positioned the company as an essential player in the renewable energy sector in the region. The company also keeps expanding its footprint in the Brazilian market, where it has established itself with three more operating plants in the State of Bahia and another plant in the State of Cear&#195;&#161;: S&#195;&#163;o Pedro (67MW), Sert&#195;&#163;o Solar Barreiras (117 MW), Eng. Manoel de Andrade, previously known as Juazeiro (167MW) and Sol do Futuro (81 MW).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Jacarand&#195;&#161; project will be neighboring the Eng. Manoel de Andrade solar plant and will make use of its digital substation, a breakthrough innovation, first-of-its-kind in the Brazilian solar industry, introduced by Atlas Renewable Energy in 2019. Furthermore, the Jacarand&#195;&#161; project will host bi-facial module technology, a major cutting-edge technology in solar energy. These innovative solar panels use the reflection of the sun's rays from their front and back sides, increasing the efficiency of the photoelectric conversion, therefore enhancing the overall efficiency of the plant.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As part of Atlas Renewable Energy's commitment to the State of Bah&#195;&#173;a, the Jacarand&#195;&#161; plant's construction will develop programs to bolster local communities' overall wellbeing. The project will provide training and employment focused on creating new skills for locals. It will also advocate for gender equality by implementing the program: "We are all part of the same energy" developed by Atlas Renewable Energy. This program focuses on the promotion of inclusive practices by empowering the local female workforce through training that will enhance or create new skills. This will allow local women to have access to new job opportunities within the project and uplift their skillsets and potential by integrating them into more specialized jobs. Thanks to this program the company is expecting to hire 3 to 4 times more women than the female workforce usually hired during the construction of solar projects in Brazil. In addition, the execution of the Jacarand&#195;&#161; project is expected to have a maximum of 1,200 workers, of which a 70% is expected to be from local workforce.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Dow is pleased to partner with leading clean power producers like Atlas Renewable Energy as we work to reduce our emission intensity and support projects that add greater renewable contribution and diversity to the grid/matrix," said Claudia Schaeffer, Dow's global business director for Energy &#38; Climate Change. "In addition to our passion for a lower carbon future, our companies share a commitment to ESG (Environmental Social and Governance) principles that encourage economic growth and social development for the communities where we operate."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Carlos Barrera, Atlas Renewable Energy CEO mentioned: "Atlas is positioning itself as the right partner for large consumers in Latin America to serve them with clean energy and help lower their carbon footprints and reduce their costs. Our aim is to create competitive clean energy solutions for our clients by developing and implementing new, world-class renewable energy projects, all while acting responsibly with local communities. We look forward to continue supporting Dow, and other energy users across Brazil and Latin America to reduce their carbon footprints while reducing their electricity bill."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Luis Pita, General Manager of Atlas Renewable Energy for Brazil, emphasized: "We aim to continue to boost the thriving bilateral market in Brazil by implementing top-of-the-line solutions with novel technology and the highest-in-class sustainability standards in all our projects. It is an honor for us to partner with Dow, a leader in its sector that stands out for its ambitious sustainable approach in operations and culture." He also added: "We are also breaking ground in this project by implementing our program"We&#194;&#180;re all part of the same energy", centered in the inclusion and promotion of qualified female labor force, through the development of training programs and the application of the learnings during the construction and operational phase of the plant. This will definitely help promote and integrate female workforce in the region."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Luiz Ballester, Commercial Director for Atlas Renewable Energy in Brazil, also commented: "Signing a corporate or bilateral PPA is usually an intricate and detailed process where many variables come to play. Our expertise in the matter and financial capabilities have proven to be a major differentiator for sophisticated large energy consumers, like Dow, when implementing clean energy solutions from development to full operation. Our strong know-how and bankability allow us to provide an all-encompassing service - we believe in creating a personalized and tailor-made solution that can effectively maximize each client's goals while ensuring predictability and long-term commitment."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>How Having Bigger AI Models Can Have A Detrimental Impact On Environment</title>
            <link>https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-having-bigger-ai-models-can-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-environment/</link>
            <description> The COVID crisis has skyrocketed the applications of artificial intelligence  from tackling this global pandemic, to being a vital tool in managing various business processes.&#60;p&#62;Despite its benefits, AI has always been scrutinised for its ethical concerns like existing biases and privacy issues. However, this technology also has some significant sustainability issues  it is known to consume a massive amount of energy, creating a negative impact on the environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As AI technology is getting advanced in predicting weather, understanding human speech, enhancing banking payments, and revolutionising healthcare, the advanced models are not only required to be trained on large datasets, but also require massive computing power to improve its accuracy. Such heavy computing and processing consumes a tremendous amount of energy and emits carbon dioxide, which has become an environmental concern.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to a report, it has been estimated that the power required for training AI models emits approximately 626,000 pounds (284 tonnes) of carbon dioxide, which is comparatively five times the lifetime emissions of the average US car. This highlights the magnitude of the environmental problem training these AI models can create. Alongside, experts believe that these numbers are only the baseline value; the model, in actuality, tends to consume much more energy when it gets in the real-world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; How OpenAI's Largest AI Model Can Have A Severe Impact On Environment&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Open AI had recently launched their biggest AI language model  GPT-3 , which has been designed to achieve accurate results on a set of benchmark and unique natural language processing tasks for translating different languages, generating news as well as helping students with their competitive exams by answering assessment questions. With its new version of 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 can bring in some significant environmental issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One of the primary reasons is the massive amount of energy that is being consumed by these newer bigger AI models. In fact, OpenAI, in their blog post has stated that improvement in computing power is the key component for the AI progress, and therefore, it would continue to exponentially increase with a 3.4-month doubling time. While the previous model, GPT-2 was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages to gain accuracy, GPT-3 , being one of the largest AI models, required even more fine-tuning datasets of thousands of examples, with more energy consumption and significant carbon emission&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In fact, one of the most energy-consuming processes has always been training NLPs. In 2018, Google developed BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which was pre-trained on 40 epochs with over 3.3 billion words to achieve best NLP performance . This was later overpowered by another model, which was trained on 32 billion words. Such extensive operations of training neural networks on billions and billions of words required machine translation, sentence construction and other lengthy benchmarking tasks, and thus, demand higher computing power and massive energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Apart from training the model, in order to make it accurate, it also undergoes thorough experimentation, which again yields a substantial energy consumption. Testing the AI model is primarily done by trial and error methods to optimise the neural architecture. These tuning processes consume a lot of energy, adding to carbon emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Once the model is trained and experimented on, it goes through the deployment process, which has separate energy requirements. In fact, according to NVIDIA,  80-90% of the cost of neural networks lies in inference processing , where the capabilities learned by the AI model are put to the test in the real-world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Another critical energy use issue is when data centres of recent era utilise a huge amount of electricity. According to an estimation, data centres usually use upto 200 TW of energy each year , which is way higher than the national energy consumption of many countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; An AI researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Roy Schwartz once said that the larger the AI models get, the more energy they will consume. If we continue this growth, we will see a much more significant negative impact on the environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And, thus, it has been established that the more accurate the AI model is, with more parameters, the more energy it will consume, creating repercussions for the environment. Consequently, there is a growing concern of finding solutions that will consume lesser energy and produce lower carbon footprint while training, experimenting and developing these AI models.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Renewable AI Is The Solution&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With AI continuing to advance without any guidelines, it is believed to have a more significant impact on the climate. In recent research, MIT researchers have noted that the most amount of energy that is consumed is usually done by Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which is a crucial technique to automate the architecting process of neural networks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, things might change, going by the goals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which has seen participation from tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, as well as Google. The cohort have reportedly pledged to use renewable energy in the coming years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability, Amazon has stated in their company release that With nearly 70 renewable energy projects around the globe  including 54 solar rooftops  we are making significant progress towards reaching Amazon's company-wide commitment to reaching 100% renewable energy by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Google, on the other hand, has also initiated agreements with renewable energy suppliers as well as using machine learning to reduce its energy consumption&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In fact, in recent news, Tech Mahindra has also signed a joint declaration with UN Global Compact , along with 155 global companies, affirming its commitments towards zero carbon footprint and green economy. COVID-19 has allowed all of us to reconfigure our priorities, said, MD &#38; CEO, Tech Mahindra, CP Gurnani. We are committed to building a sustainable business with responsibility and by creating value for our stakeholders, while also keeping in mind the long-term impacts on the environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Alongside, MIT researchers have also developed an automated artificial intelligence system for training and running central neural networks. The researchers claim that by improving the computational efficiency of the system in some key ways, the system can cut down the pounds of carbon emissions involved  in some cases, down to low triple digits.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Explaining further the researchers said that the system already encompasses many pre-trained subnetworks, which enhanced the training process of the larger neural network. According to research estimates, the system would require 1/1300 the carbon emissions compared to the traditional methods of NAS.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; To avoid this impact, researchers should include in their report, the amount of computational cost of training algorithms, which would enhance transparency in the industry. In fact, to keep a count, a team of ML practitioners have developed a tool  Machine Learning Emissions Calculator  to help companies keep a check on the carbon emissions generated by the models we train, as well as ways to reduce those emissions. The system works on factors like energy consumed by the system's hardware, training time, location of the data centre, per unit electricity used and associated carbon offsets, and estimated how much CO2 would be generated during these processes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Another promising way of reducing carbon footprints is by choosing the right geographical location of cloud servers, and analysing if the local grid uses renewable or non-renewable sources. Such a decision can indeed make a huge impact on the carbon emission of the AI model. As a matter of fact, Alexandra Luccioni , an AI researcher with MILA, said People often choose the server based on availability, or proximity, or personal preference, but choosing a low-carbon server in a location like Quebec or California can reduce the amount of carbon produced by a factor of 100.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Tech giants can also assist companies with less computational resources by sharing their models. Such an initiative by tech giants will allow companies to build their models on top of the shared models, without emitting more carbon in building, training and deploying AI models from scratch.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Wrapping Up&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The carbon footprint issue of AI is usually overshadowed by its accuracy factor, which is the primary reason for developing AI. However as the models are getting advanced, the cost of energy is getting bigger, which in turn increases the environmental impact as well . Considering AI is going to stay as well as further advance, it is critical to have an awareness of the climatic impact the AI model can have.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; One of the essential steps is to create transparency in developing AI models. And for this, while publishing the research, it should be mandatory for them to mention the energy consumption as well as its performance metrics. Alongside, it should become the best practice for companies as well as researchers to create more efficient ways to train and deploy models for creating a sustainable future.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Provide your comments below&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; comments&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Thai Acrylic Fibre launches documentary on Radianza</title>
            <link>http://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/fibre-news/thai-acrylic-fibre-launches-documentary-on-radianza-268310-newsdetails.htm</link>
            <description> Thai Acrylic Fibre Co Ltd, a unit of Aditya Birla group in Thailand manufacturing acrylic fibre, has launched a new video for its eco-friendly fibre, Radianza. Company said that this video is to emphasise, Radianza as one of the solutions to stay in sustainable fashion and how much the fibre can save natural resources and impact to the environment.&#60;p&#62;One is the full documentary with 3.28 minutes and another is a short commercial length 1 minute.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since we have launched Radianza into the market, we have received more and more inquiry from our customers and got attentions from brands, and mills that now are shifting to sustainable products and looking for materials to fill in their sustainable ranges. What is happening now is, people only concern about raw materials to make sustainable products, said Ashwini Chotani, chief marketing officer of Thai Acrylic Fibre, said in a press release.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, no matter they are natural or synthetic fibres need to pass through a lot of production process, and each process consumes a lot of natural resources. Dyeing process is one of the most toxic stages in our industry. It consumes a lot of water, energy, chemicals, and also pollutes by discharging unused dyes back into the environment. All of these are hidden behind which is barely communicated to the public. That is the reason why we created this documentary to, at least, remind everyone that sustainability and eco-friendly should take the whole process into concern.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thai Acrylic Fibre assigned a third party to conduct Life-Cycle-Assessment (LCA), to study about Radianza fibre compared to conventional dyeing and other materials in all eco-friendlys aspects. The report showed that, by using Radianza to make one garment could save up to 30 litres of water, create 1.45kg less carbon dioxide equivalent Global Warming potential, consume approximately 25MJ less energy, and create around 3/4th of the kg SO2 equivalent Human Toxicity Potential.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The documentary starts with explaining the facts of textile processing and what is happening now in those manufacturing countries and the environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We hope everyone will like and enjoy watching this documentary. We plan to promote this video to the designers, textile and fashion students, and to end consumers. Our intention is to communicate a little more about sustainable fashion and hope everyone take it to consideration a little more when making decision to buy clothes in stores Chotani said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Click here to view the documentary&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fibre2Fashion News Desk (JL)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>BMW 3 Series electric car spotted testing, expected launch in 2023 - Report</title>
            <link>https://indianautosblog.com/bmw-3-series-electric-car-spotted-testing-p321021</link>
            <description> A BMW 3 Series electric car has been spotted testing. The new electric vehicle is expected to be launched in 2023.&#60;p&#62;The front end of the prototype of the BMW 3 Series electric car features a cleaner look and is likely to have an enclosed kidney grille because theres no need to channel air into the engine bay.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The prototype of the BMW 3 Series electric car that has been spied on a test features a design that is very similar to that of the conventional BMW 3 Series. Elements such as the LED taillamps, outside rearview mirrors with integrated LED turn signals, sloping roofline, sharp boot lid, do remind us of the regular 3 Series sedan. However, there are some visual changes that the company has implemented in the electric version of the salon. These aesthetic updates are hidden behind the camouflage stickers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These are the mandatory Electric Test Vehicle camouflage stickers which tell us that the prototype is, indeed, of an electric vehicle. It can be seen in the spy pictures that the rear bumper does not have any cutouts for the exhaust system. This further confirms the fact that this is an electric car.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, the front end of the prototype of the BMW 3 Series electric car features a cleaner look and is likely to have an enclosed kidney grille because theres no need to channel air into the engine bay. Just as the exterior of the electric BMW 3 Series, the interior is also likely to be similar to that of the regular BMW 3 Series.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The BMW 3 Series electric car prototype seen in these spy images appears to be based on the regular cars long-wheelbase version, which is a China-exclusive model, however, is expected to be launched in India by mid-2021. The extra room between the axles would have allowed BMW to use a larger battery pack.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The BMW 3 Series electric car prototype seen in these spy images appears to be based on the regular cars long-wheelbase version.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Fresh Details of Sixth-Gen BMW M3 G80 Revealed in a New Video&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While BMW has not released any official information regarding the electric 3 Series, it is being anticipated that the EV would borrow the electric powertrain from the upcoming BMW iX3 electric crossover. BMW had earlier announced its goal of having 25 electric cars in its entire product line-up by 2023 and it seems that the electric BMW 3 Series would be one of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Commercial Coal Mining May See Weak Investor Sentiment - ICRA</title>
            <link>https://steelguru.com/coal/commercial-coal-mining-may-see-weak-investor-sentiment-icra/560776</link>
            <description> A report by credit ratings agency ICRA said that the prospects of commercial coal mining in India may be dimmer than initially expected because of&#60;p&#62;the expected shift in Indias energy mix from fossil fuel-based power to renewable energy. The rollout of this government reform at a time when the economic outlook remains uncertain amid the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to weak investor sentiment. ICRA Senior Vice-President &#38; Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings Jayanta Roy said In a market, where an overwhelming majority of the domestic supply is controlled by Coal India and Singareni Collieries, affordability, dependability and consistency in coal quality would remain critical drivers that would determine if the existing coal customers decide to partly shift their sourcing to private commercial coal miners. Experienced players, who have the knowhow of efficiently operating a coal mining business, stand a better chance in making a dent in the market share of the existing players. Over the long-term, we believe that coal consumers are likely to benefit from increased competition in the domestic coal mining industry."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The domestic coal demand is estimated to increase at a modest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% between FY2021 and FY2027, ICRA estimated. This is much lower than the CAGR of 5.2% registered between FY2013 and FY2020. Given Coal Indias ambitious target to reach 1 billion tonne coal production by FY2024, private commercial miners would face stiff competition in gaining a foothold in the domestic market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Billions of dollars for share market put on hold; MSCI defers raising India weight in global indices</title>
            <link>https://www.financialexpress.com/market/msci-index-india-weightage-change-defered-indefinitely-by-morgan-stanley-capital-investment-billions-of-dollars-on-hold/2009725/</link>
            <description> Share market, eagerly awaiting for an increase in Indias weightage in MSCI global index, has yet again been handed a disappointment by the global index major as it deferred increasing foreign ownership limit indefinitely.&#60;p&#62;Earlier this year, as the MSCI index rejig looked almost certain with even Morgan Stanley predicting the quantum of inflows into Indian share markets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Share market, eagerly awaiting for an increase in Indias weightage in MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital Investment) global index, has yet again been handed a disappointment by the global index major as it deferred increasing foreign ownership limit (FOL) indefinitely. MSCI was due to announce changes to its Global Standard Index by June 30. The change in Indias weightage was expected to rope in billions of dollars in active and passive flows into Indian share markets. Instead, experts say that the move will disappoint domestic markets and could result in funds flowing out of some stocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MSCI will defer until further notice potential increases in FOL resulting from the recently implemented relaxation of the Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) limit of Indian companies to the sectoral limit, MSCI said in a release. The regulatory change that was announced by the Finance Minister a year ago was made effective by the depository institutions CDSL and NSDL in the beginning of April, increasing foreign ownership limit for all listed companies to their sectoral limits. MSCI said that the changes are new and more time is required for market participants to test the disclosure mechanism.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to global brokerage and research firm Morgan Stanley, the change in Indias weightage could bring in passive inflows of over $1.4 billion and active inflows of $5.7 billion. The market was looking forward towards this even because the quantum of funds that were expected to come in was humongous, Ajay Bodke, CEO  PMS, Prabhudas Lilladher told Financial Express Online. The funds that would have come in from a change had the potential to take the market into a different trajectory at a time when the economic outlook continues to remain grim and geo-political tensions heightened, Ajay Bodke added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earlier this year, as the MSCI index rejig looked almost certain with even Morgan Stanley predicting the quantum of inflows into Indian share markets, brokerage firms had been rushing to predict which stocks would benefit from a change. Brokerage firm Emkay Global was expecting Tata Consumer, Torrent Pharma, Jubilant Food, Biocon, Alkem Lab, and Ipca Labs to benefit from the change. Morgan Stanley had said that L&#38;T, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Nestle, and Diviss Lab could see an increase in weightage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Basically they had said they will come up with something by June end and there was build up in some stocks like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Nestle, L&#38;T. Anyway, they were to spread it over a few quarters as FTSE did so we were expecting this to spread longer, said Nitesh Jain, VP  Institutional Derivatives Research, Motilal Oswal. What is more troubling for market participants is the uncertainty MSCI has left them with, giving no definite timeline as to when the decision would be revisited. They have not indicated when they will revisit this, maybe in three months or in the next year so there is a deep sense of disappointment. The reason they have given does not look very convincing, Ajay Bodke said. A surge in foreign flows post increase in Indias weightage would have helped domestic markets at a time when foreign investors have been pulling money away in large sums.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T flag-off final assembly of the Cryostat to ITER, France</title>
            <link>http://www.epcworld.in/p/post/l-t-flag-off-final-assembly-of-the-cryostat-to-iter-france</link>
            <description> The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro, has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of Cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world. This is an important milestone in the global nuclear fusion arena as well as a moment of pride for the Make in India&#60;p&#62;initiative.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on this occasion, Dr. Bernard Bigot, Director-General, ITER organization said, Today, in Hazira, we celebrate with you the completion of fabrication of all the segments of the Cryostat, including most recently the segments of the Cryostat Lid - again achieved under these challenging conditions. The ITER Project and ITER-India were very fortunate to have Larsen &#38; Toubro as our partner and the primary contractor for Cryostat fabrication(as) the challenge of the Cryostat was unique.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on this achievement, SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &#38; MD, L&#38;T said, This is a proud moment for the company, as it has completed another milestone in the development of worlds largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber. The company has used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high- quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER. This will further pave a way for the installation of Cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power. It has empowered India to tread towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat by acquiring knowledge in this highly specialised field of science and technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Cryostat assembly referred as the Top Lid, weighing 650 MT (metric tons), is to be installed with other Cryostat segments for ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in a Reactor pit in southern France. L&#38;T has already delivered the Base section, the Lower Cylinder and the Upper Cylinder for the Cryostat. The Cryostats function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Anil V Parab, Executive Vice President and Head, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering said With the supply of the Top Lid sector, we have successfully completed our India scope of the project ahead of the schedule. The fabrication of these components has been an engineering marvel both in terms of its massive size and its stringent quality standards. This is a proud moment for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering, which is showcasing Indian capabilities in the high technology arena at the global stage.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering is divided into three aspects. Firstly, the company was to manufacture assemblies at its state-of-the-art Hazira manufacturing complex. The second aspect involved constructing a temporary workshop at the project site in Cadarache, France for the assembly of various sectors. And finally, it is to integrate the Cryostat with the Tokamak Reactor building. With this flag-off, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has completed the manufacturing work planned in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts Heavy Engineering business won this prestigious contract from ITER India, a wing of Department of Atomic Energy, for the ambitious mega scientific project, conducted in collaboration of seven elite countries including India and with a project outlay of around $20 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The virtual flag-off ceremony at Hazira manufacturing complex was attended by officials from Niti Ayog, ITER India, ITER global, DAE, Rajiv Gandhi Science &#38; Technology Commission, NPCIL, AERB and BARC joining through digital platforms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MARKET COMMENTARY Sensex, Nifty extend gains</title>
            <link>http://www.citrusinteractive.in/News/OpenNewsContent.aspx?SecId=4&#38;SubSecID=41&#38;NewsID=786936</link>
            <description> Indian equity benchmarks extended their gains in late morning deals, on the back of firm cues from other Asian markets. Axis Bank emerged as top gainer among all major industry leaders on the BSE in morning deals. Sentiments were positive, as a gauge of India's manufacturing sector jumped in June, as economic activity resumed after the nation eased curbs introduced to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, compiled by IHS Markit, stood at 47.2 in June compared with 30.8 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis.&#60;p&#62;On the global front, Asian markets were trading mostly in green, as the manufacturing sector in Malaysia swung back to expansion in June, with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.1. That's up from 42.7 in May, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. Individually, output growth matched a survey record as factory output rebounded sharply. The downturn in demand slowed following the easing of lockdown restrictions, while business confidence climbed amid improved economic conditions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The BSE Sensex is currently trading at 35164.63, up by 248.83 points or 0.71% after trading in a range of 34927.20 and 35191.84. There were 16 stocks advancing against 14 stocks declining on the index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The broader indices were trading mixed; the BSE Mid cap index lost 0.05%, while Small cap index was up by 0.28%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Bankex up by 1.13%, Energy up by 0.59%, Telecom up by 0.47%, Basic Materials up by 0.33% and Auto up by 0.15%, while Power down by 1.55%, Capital Goods down by 1.31%, Utilities down by 0.95%, Healthcare down by 0.78% and Industrials down by 0.55% were the top losing indices on BSE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The top gainers on the Sensex were Axis Bank up by 3.84%, HDFC up by 3.26%, Bajaj Finance up by 3.20%, Bajaj Finserv up by 2.89% and SBI up by 2.49%. On the flip side, NTPC down by 3.08%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.57%, ONGC down by 2.40%, Nestle down by 2.26% and Larsen &#38; Toubro down by 2.10% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) in its data has showed that the fiscal deficit widened to Rs 4.66 lakh crore or 58.6% of the Budget Estimates (BE) during the first two months of the current financial year (FY21) mainly on account of poor tax collection due to the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. The fiscal deficit during the corresponding period of last year was be 52% of the budget estimates. However, these figures have to be revised significantly in view of the economic disruptions created by the outbreak of the coronavirus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit stood at Rs 4,66,343 crore at end-May. The deficit was 35.1% of BE at end-April. Fiscal deficit had soared to a seven-year high of 4.6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019-20, mainly on account of poor revenue realisation which dipped further towards the close of March because of lockdown to contain spread of coronavirus. The government had pegged the fiscal deficit for 2020-21 at Rs 7.96 lakh crore or 3.5% of the GDP in the budget which was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the CGA data, revenue receipts of the government stood at Rs 44,667 crore or 2.2% of the BE. During the same period of the last fiscal, the realisation was 7.3% of the BE. The tax revenue stood at Rs 33,850 crore or 2.1% of BE during the first two months of the fiscal. Total receipts of the government were 2% of the BE or 45,498 crore. In the Budget, the government had estimated the total receipts for the fiscal at Rs 22.45 lakh crore. The government's total expenditure stood at Rs 5.11 lakh crore or 16.8% of the BE at end-May. During the same period of the last fiscal, the total expenditure was 18.4% of the BE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The CNX Nifty is currently trading at 10364.00, up by 61.90 points or 0.60% after trading in a range of 10299.60 and 10372.55.

On the flip side, NTPC down by 3.08%, Kotak Mahindra Bank down by 2.69%, Cipla down by 2.54%, ONGC down by 2.34% and Nestle down by 2.23% were the top losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Asian markets were trading mostly in green; Taiwan Weighted strengthened 107.09 points or 0.92% to 11,728.33, Shanghai Composite gained 27.10 points or 0.91% to 3,011.77, Straits Times advanced 24.72 points or 0.95% to 2,614.63, KOSPI rose 9.97 points or 0.47% to 2,118.30.

            <title>Global oil demand, CO2 emissions likely peaked in 2019: Energy consultancy</title>
            <link>https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/global-oil-demand-co2-emissions-likely-peaked-in-2019-energy-consultancy-855732.html</link>
            <description> Global oil demand and carbon dioxide emissions probably peaked in 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on both, energy consultancy DNV GL said on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62;The Norway-based consultancy, which advises both petroleum and renewable energy companies on risk management and technology, said global energy use would be 8% lower in 2050 than previously expected due to the impact of the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Lasting behavioural changes to travel, commuting and working habits will also decrease energy usage and lessen demand for fossil fuels from the transport sector as well as from iron and steel production," DNV GL said in a statement about its research on the impact of the pandemic on oil demand and emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"While we expect oil demand to recover next year, we think that it's likely that it will never reach the levels seen in 2019," Sverre Alvik, head of DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook, told Reuters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The International Energy Agency said on June 16, it did not expect oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 due to a slump in air travel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;DNV GL has previously predicted oil demand would plateau in 2022.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Growing scepticism about long-term global oil demand in a post-pandemic world is putting pressure on oil companies to revalue their assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shell said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the outlook for energy prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Renewable energy is seen benefiting from the crisis, because when total energy demand falls, the cheapest sources, such as wind and solar, are preferred to fossil fuels, Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While global CO2 emissions also likely peaked in 2019, the expected decline in future would not be steep enough to meet the Paris climate agreement goals, so other measures such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater use of hydrogen were needed, DNV GL said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"COVID-19 has shown that behavioural changes are indeed possible, and we can use this opportunity to make a change which is good for (the) climate," Alvik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Floating Solar to Produce 900% Additional Electricity in the APAC: IEEFA Report</title>
            <link>https://www.energetica-india.net/news/floating-solar-to-produce-900-additional-electricity-in-the-apac-ieefa-report</link>
            <description> Asia tops Europe in installing floating solar, a new IEEFA report finds. Energy finance analysts Sara Jane Ahmed and Elrika Hamdi at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) note that power demand in the Philippines and Malaysia has dropped by as much as 16 percent during the COVID-19 lockdown, causing extreme stress to electricity grids due to excess power, although such falls have been smaller in Vietnam and Singapore where the pandemic measures have been less stringent to date.&#60;p&#62;If the COVID-19 outbreak is to teach one lesson, it would be that utility companies need agile operations, not outdated power stations that burn coal 24/7 and cannot respond quickly to sudden changes or outages, said Ahmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our research shows more and more ASEAN countries are building solar farms that float on rivers, dams, lakes and reservoirs  even the sea  to produce clean electricity at prices that can compete with power from polluting coal-fired plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Solar farms are best when installed near hydropower facilities and able to piggyback existing connections to electricity grids, according to the report. Floating solar power can also balance out the peaks and troughs of consumer demand in complex electricity systems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The combination of floating solar and hydro on existing dams and reservoirs trumps the economics of adding new baseload coal-fired power plants on-grid systems such as the Java-Bali network that already have generation overcapacity, said Hamdi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Floating solar installations have shown they can withstand typhoons, powerful waves, and winds gusting up to 170 kilometres an hour, with offshore FPV now being tested by manufacturers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Further, water-borne solar installations are much quicker to build than fossil-fuelled power stations and can be ready in a matter of months, while coal, gas, hydro generators take up to three years to build, and nuclear plants take much longer, adds Hamdi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The first FPV system was built in 2007 in Aichi, Japan, while China is the largest FPV player. At the end of 2018, both Japan and China had a combined FPV installed capacity of 1.3 GW. Vietnam has installed 47 MW of FPV, and most recently, Indias largest power generation firm, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), confirmed it has 200 MW of FPV under development across four sites, making it one of the largest developers in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Up to 2019, the total installed capacity of FPVs among ASEAN countries was mostly below 1 MW. This has changed drastically with at least five countries recently announcing large-scale floating solar plans:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Singapore: in February 2019, Singapores Cleantech Solar announced the completion of a 9.8 MW solar installation that includes a mix of rooftop solar and 2.8 MW of FPV on a water reservoir to power Cambodian cement manufacturer Chip Mong Insee Cement Corporation (CMIC). Singapores water authority, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) procured 50 MW of FPV on the Tengeh Reservoir in July 2019, with a targeted operational date of 2021. PUB is also in the process of implementing two smaller 1.5 MW FPV systems on the Bedok and Lower Seletar reservoirs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thailand: In June 2019, Thailands EGAT issued an invitation for 55.5 MW of FPV on the Sirindhorn Dam, co-located with the existing 12 MW Sirindhorn Hydropower Plant. Thailands EGAT is also planning for a second FPV with a capacity of 24 MW on the Ubol Ratana Dam. Then in January 2020, a consortium comprised of Thailands B Grimm Power Plc and Energy China was awarded a contract to build 45MW of FPV on the Sirindhorn Dam by EGAT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Malaysia: In August 2019, Malaysias Pestech entered a partnership with Chinas inverter maker Sungrow to jointly develop FPV solutions in the region, while in October 2019 Chinese solar manufacturer Risen Energy Co. Ltd secured a contract to supply 150 MW of PV modules to power a floating PV park.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Vietnam: In October 2019, Vietnams Da NhimHam ThuanDa Mi (DHD), a subsidiary of national utility EVN which owns and operates hydro plants, commissioned 47.5 MW of FPV, with a targeted increase of 330 MW more in an area where 1MW alone may be able to light 165 homes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Philippines: In October 2019, Philippines Meralco Powergen Corp, a subsidiary of the countrys largest utility company, announced its plans to build 110 MW of FPV on Laguna Lake.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Indonesia: In January 2020, Indonesias state-owned PLN utility company signed an FPV deal with UAEs Masdar for a targeted 145 MW.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, the decision to install FPVs is based primarily on the economics of existing grid infrastructure and the issue of land scarcity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Focusing on the economics of generation assets in isolation does not make sense because of the need to invest in transmission lines. A grid-level solution, considering the cost of generation plus transmission requirements, is key, adds Ahmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The geography and demographics of ASEAN present a distinctive opportunity for floating solar, concludes Hamdi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>GST turns 3, but 'one nation, one tax' dream still far from reality</title>
            <link>https://www.etvbharat.com/english/national/business/economy/gst-turns-3-but-one-nation-one-tax-dream-still-far-from-reality/na20200701121611756</link>
            <description> Published on : 4 minutes ago Multiple tax slabs, different registration rules for different states are the key hurdles in GST's aim of making&#60;p&#62;India a single national market with uniform tax rates across all goods and services.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Hyderabad: India is celebrating the third birthday of the landmark Goods and Services Tax (GST) today, albeit with a half-baked cake. Widely hailed as the one of the biggest ever tax reforms, GST was introduced in India on 1 July 2017 with the intent of bringing the country under the One nation, one tax' regime. But even after three years, that remains a distant dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Experts believe that though GST has smoothened the flow of goods across states in the country and widened the tax base, all while removing the cascading tax effect, it has still not taken a form that intended to make India a single national market with uniform tax rates across all goods and services.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; I have a mixed feeling on the past three years of GST,, said Satish Saraf, a GST expert who is also a member of the Telangana GST Grievance Redressal Committee. The good thing is that we have increased the tax base, improved transparency in the system, made refunds for exporters easier and quicker, but issues like multiple slabs still a concern.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Currently, the GST rate varies from anywhere between 0.25% and 28%, sometimes with additional cess, with several items also falling in the exempt category or nil duty. Saraf said the government is now reportedly planning to merge all these rates into three major slabs. If that is made possible, then it will become a good GST, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Government think-tank NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand had also in December made a case for only two slabs under the GST regime and said rates should be revised only annually if required. We should not fiddle with rates or change rates frequently... We should not have many rates. Have only two rates, he had said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Different states, different rules&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Besides multiple rates, GST is also witnessing a problem of certain differences in registration rules for different states, again not a healthy sign for a regime that aims to unify the nation. According to rules, every supplier of goods with annual turnover of Rs 40 lakh or more is required to register with the government's GST portal. However, this threshold is Rs 20 lakh in states like Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura and Uttarakhand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Similarly, for services, GST registration is mandatory for all businesses with turnover of Rs 20 lakh or more, except in Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, where this threshold is Rs 10 lakh.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Some near-term complexities have also emerged in the system after the Covid-19 pandemic struck the Indian economy. In an attempt to bring relief to taxpayers, the government extended due dates for filing GST returns. But that also varies from state to state and also on the size of the business, which has resulted in confusion and chaos, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Commenting on the same, GST expert Pritam Mahure said: After three years, the celebrated motto i.e. one nation, one tax' has been reduced to One nation, many states, one tax, many rates' or One nation, many states, one tax, many due dates'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Mahure said Indian taxpayers are now hoping that the GST Council, which is the policy-making body for GST, starts taking decisions considering the long-term vision with the start of the fourth year of the taxing reform.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Besides these challenges, the fact that petroleum products and real estate  two major revenue sources for the economy -- have still been kept out of the GST ambit has always raised eyebrows. There is a strong case for a national parity for the prices of the automobile fuel, otherwise the broader objective of a single market under the GST remains unfulfilled, Industry body ASSOCHAM Secretary General Deepak Sood had told media in May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Saraf agrees, too. The government should bring petroleum products under the ambit of GST. This will not only lower the cost of petroleum products, but will also boost the economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (ETV Bharat Report)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> News IEEFA report: Volts from the blue  floating solar to generate 900% more electricity across Asia-Pacific By Sanjana Kamble&#60;p&#62;Asia leads Europe in deploying floating solar, also known as floating photovoltaic (FPV), a new IEEFA report finds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Energy finance analysts Sara Jane Ahmed and Elrika Hamdi note that power demand in the Philippines and Malaysia has dropped by as much as 16% during the COVID-19 lockdown, causing extreme stress to electricity grids due to excess power, although such falls have been smaller in Vietnam and Singapore where the pandemic measures have been less stringent to date.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If the COVID-19 outbreak is to teach one lesson, it would be that utility companies need agile operations, not outdated power stations that burn coal 24/7 and cannot respond quickly to sudden changes or outages, says Ahmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; OUR RESEARCH SHOWS MORE AND MORE ASEAN COUNTRIES ARE BUILDING SOLAR FARMS that float on rivers, dams, lakes and reservoirs  even the sea  to produce clean electricity at prices that can compete with power from polluting coal-fired plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Solar farms are best when installed near hydropower facilities and able to piggyback existing connections to electricity grids, according to the report.

A grid-level solution, considering the cost of generation plus transmission requirements, is key, says Ahmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET COMPETITIVELY PRICED GENERATION through technology-specific auctions of power, and Southeast Asia stands to benefit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Clean energy sources such as floating solar power can help insulate coal-importing ASEAN countries from the risk of volatile fuel prices and the expensive supply logistics of the global fossil fuels market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The geography and demographics of ASEAN present a distinctive opportunity for floating solar, says Hamdi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>MNRE Clarifies Lockdown Period to be Considered for Renewable Project Extensions</title>
            <link>https://mercomindia.com/mnre-clarifies-lockdown-period/</link>
            <description> In April, the Ministry had said that the projects would be granted an extension considering the nationwide lockdown&#60;p&#62;In an important clarification, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( MNRE ) has announced that the period of nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 will be considered from March 25, 2020, to May 31, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is in continuation of the Ministrys earlier notice, which was issued on April 17, 2020. It had directed that the renewable energy implementing agencies be granted an extension of time for projects amounting to the total period of the lockdown plus 30 days for normalization. The industry needed a clarification on what would be the dates that would be considered as lockdown as the lockdown has been lifted in phases in various states.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The MNRE has also said that this would be a blanket extension and that there would be no need for any case-to-case investigations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The central government announced a complete lockdown of the country on March 24, 2020, to arrest the spread of the virus, which was then extended in phases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ministry said that this period of lockdown will apply to all those projects which are under the various programs of the MNRE and those which are being developed through the renewable energy implementing agencies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the Ministrys new notification, project developers may also grant the same extension period (March 25, 2020, to May 31, 2020) to other stakeholders down the value chain like the engineering procurement construction (EPC) contractors, material and equipment suppliers, and original equipment manufacturers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also stated that the timelines for intermediate milestones of a project might also be granted an extension within the extended time provided for commissioning.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The MNRE had previously issued an order directing agencies and establishments to treat any delays because of supply disruptions due to the spread of the coronavirus in China or any other country as a force majeure event and to grant suitable extensions for these projects. A force majeure is declared in the event of unforeseeable circumstances that prevent parties from fulfilling a contract.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the extended period of lockdown, the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) had issued its revised guidelines allowing the renewable industry to resume the construction of renewable energy projects from April 20, 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Find out all about the impact of the pandemic on the renewable sector on Mercoms live updates page by clicking&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> The stock market has recovered sharply from multi-year lows hit in mid-March on virus fears, but the benchmark indexes are still down around 15% for the year, having already suffered earlier in the year from a weak economy.&#60;p&#62; Meanwhile, broader Asian stocks struggled for traction as better-than-expected Chinese factory activity could not soothe worries that a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States could hinder an economic recovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In Mumbai on Wednesday, lenders HDFC Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd were among the top boosts to the Nifty, rising as much as 2.2% and 2.6%, respectively, while agro-chemical maker UPL Ltd was the top percentage gainer with a jump of 3.4%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Telecom operator Bharti Airtel rose as much as 2.7% after Carlyle said it will buy a 25% stake in Bharti's data centre arm for $235 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd dropped 3.8% to its lowest since end-May after reporting a loss for the March quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Also Read:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Pandemic sinks Japan business mood to lowest since 2009 crisis&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Indian private firms may develop 15 million tonnes capacity coal mines this year</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/indian-private-firms-may-develop-15-million-tonnes-capacity-coal-mines-this-year-11593583232312.html</link>
            <description> Analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation&#60;p&#62;CHENNAI : India's private companies could start developing coal mines with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes by the end of March, the country's coal minister told Reuters, a move that would end the near-monopoly of state-run Coal India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month officially launched the auction of 41 coal mines to companies including those in the private sector, with an annual production capacity that is nearly one third of national total output.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This year by end of March, if everything goes well, 15 million tonnes we will start this year," India's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India's consumption of coal fell 3.3% to 958 million tonnes in the year ended March 2020, and is expected to fall further this fiscal year due to the coronavirus, Joshi said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some analysts expect coal demand to be tepid, amid increased adoption of renewable energy in electricity generation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ratings agency Moody's Indian unit ICRA said on Tuesday it expects domestic coal demand is estimated to grow at 2.9% between fiscal years 2021 and 2027, nearly half the rate seen in the preceding seven years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Joshi expects demand to bounce back.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have to be prepared for a national coal consumption of 1,300-1,400 million tonnes of coal by 2023-24 including coking coal," he said, adding he expected Coal India to produce 1 billion tonnes and the private sector to account for the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, the world's second largest consumer and producer of the fuel, and saw imports rise nearly 7% this year to 251 million tonnes, with production falling for the first time in over two decades.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

            <title>Enel Bags First Solar Project Tender in India worth 420 MW</title>
            <link>https://www.energetica-india.net/news/enel-bags-first-solar-project-tender-in-india-worth-420-mw</link>
            <description> Enel Green Power has announced that it has, through its Indian renewable energy subsidiary EGP India  Avikiram Surya India, secured its first solar tender in India and has thus been awarded the right to sign a 25-year energy supply contract for a 420 MW solar project in India, which will be positioned in the state of Rajasthan and will be its first solar plant in the country.&#60;p&#62;The project was awarded under the freshly concluded 2 GW Ninth Tranche of the national solar tender issued by the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI). The tender saw India make a huge leap in the renewables industry as tariffs dropped to a record low of Rs 2.36 (USD 0.0031) per unit, for the very first time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Enel has been formally awarded 300 MW grid-tied (AC) capacity under the tender after it submitted a proposal for the same capacity with its bid of Rs 2.37/ kWh. The remaining 120 MW capacity is expected to be dc capacity which the Italian major will execute near its project.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This new tender award is testament to Enel Green Powers continuous commitment to expand its clean, sustainable energy footprint, with the aim to move forward along the Enel Groups path towards full decarbonization, said Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of Enel Green Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India represents an important market in strategic geography for our company, as it boasts a wealth of renewable resources and a highly competitive environment coupled with growing energy demand. We are proud to strengthen our presence in India with our first solar project, as we continue to contribute to the achievement of the countrys sustainable energy goals while providing clean energy with the most innovative technologies, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The construction of the solar plant, which is expected to start operations at the end of 2021, will involve an investment of approximately 180 million US dollars. Under the energy supply contract to be assigned to EGP pursuant to todays tender, the solar project will supply specified volumes of energy over a 25-year period to SECI. The facility will be able to generate more than 750 GWh of renewable energy per year, enough to avoid the annual emission of around 681,600 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> With no separate facility made for women at the temporary shelter house women feel uncomfortable&#60;p&#62;While the South Western Railway proudly boasts of running 258 Shramik trains with 3.79 lakh guest workers reaching their destination the wait for thousands of guest workers still stranded at Tripura Vasini grounds seems to have no end.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With many still continuing to lose jobs there is a spike in number of guest workers who want to return to their natives. The number of guest workers is huge from Assam and Bengal followed by Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Tuesday, over 600 guest workers after having lunch provided by the civic agency, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagare Palike (BBMP) were waiting for the information on the train but apart from a few clueless cops neither a registration desk nor an information board has been put up.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With no separate facility made for women at the temporary shelter house women feel uncomfortable.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;One of the guest workers, Jameel (name changed) from Assam said that till yesterday the toilets were not cleaned and the garbage was strewn around.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We know complex systems dont work with piecemeal or bandaid. There is no evidence of accountability at any level, no one agrees they are in charge. Everyone passes the buck. People from several districts of the state have started coming. The migrants are dependent on volunteers like us. Moreover, there is no social distancing at the shelter camps, said Rosemary Vishwanath, a volunteer with Bangalore with Migrants that is aiding the guest workers in reaching their destinations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On Monday, the volunteers described the situation as a chaos. With no public address system at the place a crowd of over 3,000 people pushed themselves onto the registration desk and only three people were doing data entry. The police personnel deployed at the venue are stressed as they are clueless about the information on the train and it becomes unmanageable for them to control the crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Apprising N Manjunath Prasad, principal secretary, revenue department and other nodal officers through a letter about the situation the civic volunteers have written that a help desk should be set up as the available ones are either switched off or the executive directs them to find a BBMP official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The complete lack of facilities continues and added to that is the lack of people to manage the basic functions of crowd management, registration, medical test, the lack of basic infrastructure like tables, medical staff, public address and any systems. The timings when the food will be served should be put up. The hall is like a furnace and it is suffocating. There is no electricity, only one generator is working, the other is not working, so the working generator is switched off in order that it does not get overheated, the report read.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Due to lack of lavatories the pressure on a few toilets is huge. After a long overhaul the toilets were cleaned on June 29. Covid-19 is a huge risk at the cramped facility being provided but the volunteers fear that due to lack of basic facilities diarrheal and gastrointestinal diseases will also begin with minimal hygiene.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is ironic that while the state government is publicising steps to contain Covid it flouts every norm when it comes to coming to aid the guest workers that are being vulnerable to the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Tech saves the day for Indias leading dairy brands as lockdowns become new normal</title>
            <link>http://www.foodprocessingbazaar.com/news/9435-tech-saves-the-day-for-india%E2%80%99s-leading-dairy-brands-as-lockdowns-become-new-normal.html</link>
            <description> When the Centre announced nationwide lockdown in the last week of March to contain the spread of Covid-19, it left several retailers engaged in the supply of essential items nervous. RS Sodhi, the indefatigable managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, popular by its dairy brand Amul, was not one of them, though. There will not be any problem, he declared with an air of confidence, back then. And, he walked, or is still walking the talk as the lockdown has stretched beyond three-weeks, and parts of India, including Mumbai, are still in a gridlock.&#60;p&#62;Amul brand, along with GCMMFs 18-member unions, touches the lives of 3.6 million farmers across about 18,700 villages of Gujarat. India's biggest dairy brand with one million plus retail touch points required an infrastructure that can support data-intensive and demanding workloads. The cooperative giants faith and steady investment in latest technology over the past 10 years has helped it wither the lockdown storm with little or no pain to dairy farmers or consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The diary giant says its modern servers help in tracking the milk supply chain where any delay in the processing of milk can hurt the quality of the end product. We are probably the largest users of technology in the dairy system in the country. Right from procurement from farmers to touching the customers, it is completely touched by technology, Sodhi told.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company invests between Rs 600 crore and Rs 800 crore every year on technology that ensures technology adoption from sourcing milk from farmers; shifting to coolers, chilling the milk and ensuring that the quality is maintained and then shifting to tankers to reach out to consumers. Technology is adopted in quality, online payment to farmers, and distribution management system for vendors to book orders as well as adoption of enterprise resource planning software from SAP.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We do more than Rs 50,000 crore business every year, without technology you cannot be in the dairy industry, said Sodhi. The dairy mogul is using IBMs latest servers to run its core operations and deliver milk and dairy products across the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Technology has been helping Amul capture data points from the last Kirana store of the network and analyze varied datasets, IBM India Director (Systems) Viswanath Ramaswamy told. This helps the diary giant to tweak the production of a certain product in sync with the fluctuation in market demand, with ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over a period of time, many smart analytics tools have been added to the technology support infrastructure to effectively manage Amul's supply chain, said Ramaswamy. In the coming years, the cooperatives, like many consumer product companies, will see use of artificial intelligence in order to make better decisions, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nandini, the second largest dairy brand after Amul, owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (KMF), is in the process of a technology overhaul. We are going in for the latest ERP technology in KMF and its units, said BC Sateesh, managing director of KMF. Its member union Bamul in Bengaluru, for example, has adopted Oracle-based ERP. Our district unions have been using their own software, and some are switching to modern ones, he said. Nandini has an annual turnover of about Rs 14,000 crore, and sources milk from about nine lakh farmers across about 254,000 villages.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;KMFs Mother Dairy unit in Bengaluru, Sateesh added, has cloud-based ERP, and all its new milk processing units are end-to-end automated with Siemens technology. Tech adoption, he said, has helped in uninterrupted supply to consumers, while at the same time, farmers are relieved their milk got marketed even in a lockdown situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Hyderabad-based private sector diary brand, Heritage Foods, is also investing big on technology. A user of IBM infrastructure, its executive director Brahmani Nara said: SAP integrated solution enables timely automated milk payments to village level suppliers. We have honoured hassle-free 100% milk procurement and payments to farmers. Technology, she added, has become the backbone in maintaining business. During lockdown, the firm ensured door delivery of products, with leads captured using WhatsApp and social media.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to her, milk transport vehicles are monitored through GPS Solutions to ensure they reach their destination in time and to maintain consistent quality. "Technology has become the backbone in maintaining business discipline and we were able to smoothly close our annual accounts in time and adhere to all compliances, despite relaxations by the Government," she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Source: Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>French Car Sales in June Show First Monthly Gain Since Virus Hit</title>
            <link>https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/french-car-sales-in-june-show-first-monthly-gain-since-virus-hit</link>
            <description> (Bloomberg) -- French car sales rose for the first time this year, sending a strong signal that government incentives are helping the sector claw back from a deep slump triggered by the coronavirus.&#60;p&#62; Passenger car registrations increased by 1.2% to 233,818 in June compared with the same month last year, according to figures published Wednesday by industry group CCFA. It was the first gain since December, before the outbreak forced shutdowns of factories and dealerships across Europe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It's encouraging even if we have to remain cautious about what will come next, Luc Chatel, head of French auto lobby La Plateforme Automobile said on BFM radio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Renault SA group volumes increased 6.5% in June, while PSA Group, including the Peugeot and Citroen brands, dropped 9.1%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For the first six months of the year, French sales are down 38.6%, CCFA said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Industry production in France stands at about 60% of pre-crisis levels and is expected to rise to about 85% this month, Chatel said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Showroom Shutdowns&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The European car industry was decimated by the coronavirus pandemic after governments ordered showrooms shut for about two months and consumers remained under lockdown. Sales across Europe are forecast to drop by a record 25% this year -- the steepest percentage drop on record -- to the lowest total since 2013.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On a monthly basis, though, the worst is likely over. Europe's auto registrations fell 57% in May, an improvement from April's 78% plunge and the French data adds to sentiment of a turnaround.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Nevertheless, carmakers are preparing to announce results this month for what is likely to be a devastating second quarter. France, Germany and Spain have unveiled aid packages for the industry, while Britain's main automotive trade group has called for government support, saying one in six jobs are at risk.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a raft of measures in May aimed at reviving France's car industry and drawing workers back to local factories.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Incentives took effect June 1 for the purchase of electric cars and a cash-for-clunkers plan encourages consumers to trade in older, more polluting cars for 200,000 new vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Chatel said the quota will likely be used up next month, calling for a phasing out of some of measures to avoid stop and go effects on the market.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#194;&#169;2020 Bloomberg L.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bloomberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Missing BloombergQuint's WhatsApp service?

            <title>RBIs Draft Framework on Sale of Loan Exposures Could Deepen Loan Markets: Ind-Ra</title>
            <link>https://www.moneylife.in/article/rbis-draft-framework-on-sale-of-loan-exposures-could-deepen-loan-markets-ind-ra/60775.html</link>
            <description> The Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) draft framework on the sale of loan exposures could lay the foundation of an efficient secondary market for loans, improve transparency and ensure proper credit risk pricing, says India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).&#60;p&#62;In a note, the ratings agency says, "Among other changes, the removal the minimum retention requirement, resale of purchased loans post a 12-month holding period and sell down of single standard assets are welcome moves to improve liquidity in the loan market. The proposed framework could facilitate long-term funding structures and encourage stronger bankruptcy remoteness in direct assignment transactions. The sale of stressed loans shall improve the speed of identification and resolutions of stress in the system."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ind-Ra opines that an independent credit evaluation at the time of loan purchases, increased digitisation of collateral charges created while lending and standardisation of loan documentations could be focus areas that can further improve the lending landscape.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The framework also encourages market participants to obtain an external credit rating for pools of standard asset during their purchase, says Ind-Ra adding that it believes this could further enhance transparency and improve price discovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the ratings agency, independent credit evaluations mentioned in the draft framework could prove critical.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The draft framework mentions buyers may have the loan pools rated before purchasing so as to have a third-party view of their credit quality in addition to their own due diligence. Also, in case of transfer of stressed assets, it becomes critical to ensure that the valuation of the exposure and associated risk capital allocation are based on an assessment of the asset to meet its contractual debt obligations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even restructured accounts have subsequently come under stress in some cases due to fundamental weaknesses in the business profile, heightened management risk or weak governance structures and unsustainable debt levels even after restructuring.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ind-Ra opines a third-party evaluation by a credit rating agency could provide an added layer of assessment and valuations for such exposures along with subsequent capital charge and provisioning norms could be linked to the outcome of such evaluation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ratings agency says it believes that the proposed framework could facilitate the development of a robust distressed asset ecosystem and speed-up the resolution of various stressed exposures. In particular, Ind-Ra says this is driven by the following two key characteristics of the proposed framework:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I. Early Identification and Resolution of Stressed Exposures: The draft framework has expanded the definition of stressed exposures to include both non-performing assets and special mention accounts. Also, the deregulation of the price discovery process will enable faster and more efficient pricing of exposures  especially when coupled with a wider range of eligible investors  as articulated earlier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;II. Enhanced Viability of Stressed Asset Takeover Structures: More importantly, the proposed framework will allow investors in stressed assets to classify the exposure as standard, although subject to any other exposure to the same entity on the investors books not being sub-standard on the date of the acquisition of the asset. This could significantly lower capital charge and provisioning requirements for the acquirer/investor of the stressed assets. Given that most stressed assets are restructured as well  often including a complete management overhaul, the rationalisation of the capital charge and provisions could make such assets more attractive to prospective acquirers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Ind-Ra, the draft framework could provide boost to long-term funding structures.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Indian credit markets have for long been bereft of avenues for mobilising capital through long-term debt instruments. As a result, liability structures for corporate borrowers in sectors such as power generation and roads front load cash outflows during the project life.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This, at least in part, reflects the non-availability of long-dated liabilities for the financial sector, the ratings agency says, adding, "Therefore, an ecosystem, which allows lenders to off-load long-dated exposures after a certain time period with reasonable foresightedness could enable borrowers to raise long-term debt instruments from the financial system in a cost-efficient manner."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The proposed framework in the current form requires the premium earned out of the sale of loan exposures to be excluded from the common equity tier 1 capital of the originator until the maturity of the exposure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For instance, a specialised infrastructure finance company funding a road asset (based on an annuity model) which chooses to sell-down its 15-year exposure two years after the commercial operational date could sell down the exposure at a premium, given that most of the project risk has been absorbed in the initial years itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Ind-Ra says, even after selling the loan exposure  resulting in the complete transfer of risk to the transferee, the originator will not be able to utilise the premium earned from the sale of the asset to meet capital/equity requirements for funding other assets on the book. "This could weigh on the equity returns of the originator and therefore continue to discourage sale of long-term funding structures," the ratings agency added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ratings agency suggests that this premium could instead be gradually included in the tier 1 capital of the transferor in line with the amortisation of the exposure through its residual tenure. Also, each of these transactions should be undertaken at an arms-length with a transparent valuation methodology  reflective of the risk profile of the exposure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"In such cases, an independent assessment of the credit risk in such exposures must be carried out via external credit ratings wherever not already available  in line with the existent regulations for capital market debt instruments," Ind-Ra says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ratings agency says it has already articulated on the significance of commingling risk, as the originator generally acts as the servicer in Indian securitisation transactions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It says, "The proposed framework clearly articulates that the transferred interest should stand completely isolated from the seller i.e., put beyond the sellers as well as its creditors' reach, even in the event of bankruptcy of the seller. Also, the framework requires the structure to ensure that there is no commingling of cash flows for an asset assignment or transferred by the transferor. In case this cannot be ensured, the transferor will be required to maintain capital, as if the asset was never transferred. This becomes especially meaningful in case of direct assignment structures  which are covered under this framework as a special case of sale of loan exposures."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"However, further clarity would be required with regard to the scenarios which could lead to the regulator to perceive the presence of material commingling of cash flows  or whether in all such assignment transactions, a separate collection and payment account (for instance via NACH amendments on day one of the direct assignment transaction) will be required to be set up to avoid commingling risk. This, however, could prove to be challenging in case of asset classes where the collection continues to be predominantly in cash and could also dampen the return accretive characteristics of direct assignment structures for such asset classes," the ratings agency says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Despite its merits, Ind-Ra says it believes that the proposed framework could discourage lenders from proactively providing against stressed assets. This is because, it says, the framework does not allow profits from the sale of stressed assets being used to reverse excess provisions made in the past, but they can only be utilised to meet the shortfall or loss on account of sale of other stressed assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, the framework does not allow such profits to be included as a part of the Tier 1 capital of the lender, rather they are eligible only for inclusion as Tier II capital, which according to the ratings agency would encourage lenders to maintain their provision coverage ratio only to the extent of the regulatory minimum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ind-Ra says it believes that further clarity is required on two additional points in the framework:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;i. The draft framework disallows the use of credit enhancement in direct assignment transactions. This could make it difficult for transferors to benefit from the partial credit guarantee scheme (announced in August 2019 and extended till 31 March 2021). Thus, transactions availing such partial credit guarantee under the scheme should be treated as an exception to this provision in the framework.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ii. The draft framework also requires the transferor to ensure registration of the security interest for the exposure and subsequent transfer of the interest to the transferee along with any necessary documentation to such effect. This could in various cases require modification to the charge documents  which could provide be operationally onerous and could result in the incidence of various regulatory levies such as stamp duty.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.projectstoday.com/News/Indian-Oil-Corporation-NTPC-and-SDMC-inks-MoU-for-waste-to-energy-plant-in-Delhi</link>
            <description> The Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), NTPC and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) entered a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop waste-to-energy plant at Okhla, Delhi.&#60;p&#62;Under the MoU, Indian Oil, SDMC and NTPC will come together to develop a demonstration waste-to-energy plant at Okhla landfill site in Delhi, using gasification technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The plant will process 17,500 tpa of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) produced from combustible components of Municipal Waste to generate syngas which will in turn be used to generate electricity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There is an existing model of providing off-take guarantee, under the SATAT scheme for compressed biogas production plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The gas generation from waste will also help in cutting imports of petroleum products and saving precious foreign exchange.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The technology being used in the Delhi plant will not only result in less emission, but also provide usable residues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &#38; Steel Dharmendra Pradhan asked IOCL, NTPC to join hands with the Department of Science and Technology, to develop Hydrogen Fuel technology.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Top wealth creators of H12020: Stocks that defied gravity to rally up to 1,600%</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-wealth-creators-of-h12020-stocks-that-defied-gravity-to-rally-up-to-1600/articleshow/76725517.cms</link>
            <description> Year to date, the indices are down 15 per cent, thanks mainly to the Covid-19 disruption.&#60;p&#62; The first half of Calendar 2020 remained highly volatile for stock investors on Dalal Street, as the benchmark equity indices slumped to hit new peaks in January-February, only to slump to new 52-week lows in March and then stage a major rebound from there,&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Year to date, the indices are down 15 per cent, thanks mainly to the Covid-19 disruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A couple of stocks have defied the trend and stepped out of this pattern to deliver up to 1,646 per cent return in these six months. On a year-to-date basis, shares of smallcap firm Alok Industries have gained the most at 1,647 per cent to trade at Rs 55 on Wednesday. It was followed by Hathway Bhawani Cabletel &#38; Datacom (up 1,348 per cent), Ruchi Infrastructure (up 559 per cent) and Opto Circuits (up 498 per cent).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Alok Industries, the Mumbai-based bankrupt integrated textile manufacturer, hogged limelight after Reliance Industries acquired it along with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company last year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As on March 31, RIL owned 37.70 per cent stake in the company, while retail and high net worth investors held 45.67 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Overall, the start of the year was marked by a lot of uncertainty amid weak macroeconomic data. The spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to a nationwide lockdown since March end, only festered the wound. Firm global cues along with monetary and fiscal measures kept the downside capped during this period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, analysts are cautious on the market for the rest of the year due to shaky fiscal situation and rising joblessness. Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, said there is fear that stress in the financial sector may sooner or later spread to the real sector of the economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Among the stocks that bucked the broader market downtrend in 2020 so far, 66 more than doubled investors' money in these six months. They included Opto Circuits, Andhra Cements, Sintex Plastics, Oswal Agro, Bilcare, Ballarpur Industries, Punj Lloyd, Suzlon Energy, Adani Green, GMM Pfaudler, Bombay Rayon, Uttam Value Steel and Apollo Finvest, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; BSE Midcap Index is down 13 per cent for the year, and BSE Smallcap Index 9 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, says consumption, agri-based, chemicals, IT and pharma stocks may lead the next rally when the economy starts reviving.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All these sectors went through a long bad patch over the past few years and they can be good bets for revival both in terms of business prospects and price action, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On BSE, 152 stocks gained between 50 per cent and 100 per cent between January and June. HLE Glascoat gained 98 per cent to trade at Rs 923 as of June 30 from Rs 467 on December 31. Other top gainers included Gammon Infra (up 97 per cent), Kilpest India (up 97 per cent), Alkyl Amines Chemicals (up 95 per cent), Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals (up 85 per cent), Ebixcash World Money India (82 per cent) and Vodafone Idea (up 80 per cent), among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Just five heavyweights capped the downside for Sensex . With over 24 per cent gain, Bharti Airtel emerged the top gainer followed by Reliance Industries (up 15 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (up 13 per cent), Nestle India (up 13 per cent) and Sun Pharmaceuticals (up 11 per cent). Other components of the 30-share pack are down up to 68 per cent YTD.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; BSE Sensex scaled its all-time high of 42,273 on January 20 and a 52-week low of 25,638 on March 24.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On the other hand, Gayatri Projects (down 79 per cent), Suven Life Sciences (down 86 per cent), Darjeeling Ropeway (down 89 per cent), Mauria Udyog (down 93 per cent) and 7NR Retail (down 93 per cent) were among the top wealth destroyers of the first half year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The July-December period is expected to be slightly better for most sectors, though financials and banks stare at a new cycle of non-performing assets (NPAs) once the moratorium ends in August, said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Other sectors should soon witness a pickup in demand. There can be supply-side hindrances with escalating tension on China border, worker shortage in cities and Covid-related movement barriers in certain states. Nifty is expected to correct from the current level. Lame demand is expected to create a lot of negative surprises due to change in consumer behaviour, which may adversely affect small businesses, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets .

            <title>Vodafone Idea share price slips 5% on Rs 11,644 crore Q4 loss</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/vodafone-idea-share-price-slips-5percent-on-rs-11644-crore-q4-loss/ar-BB16bQDK</link>
            <description> Vodafone Idea share trades higher than 20, 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages but lower than 5-day moving averages. Market capitalisation of the telecom operator stood at Rs 29,654.92 crore as of today's session.&#60;p&#62; Vodafone Idea reported 6% revenue growth to Rs 11,089 crore on QoQ basis. "After several years of hyper-competition which led to unsustainable pricing, we increased prepaid tariffs at the start of December 2019 across all price points for both unlimited plans as well as combo vouchers. As a result, revenue for the quarter improved to Rs 11,750 crore, an increase of 6.0% QoQ," the company said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company's gross debt (excluding lease liabilities) as of March 31, 2020, was Rs 1,15,000 crore, including deferred spectrum payment obligations due to the government of Rs 87,650 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Keshav Lahoti, Associate Equity Analyst, Angel Broking said, "EBIDTA grew by 28.1% due to improvement in margins to 37.3% in Q4FY20 compared to 30.8% in Q3FY20. ARPU for Q4FY20 improved to Rs 121 against Rs 109 in Q3FY20, due to prepaid tariff hike effective from Dec'19. A further impact of tariff hikes in Dec'19 will flow in the coming months. Overall, Vodafone Idea's result was better than street estimates in terms of revenue, ARPU, EBIDTA and EBIDTA margins."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Vodafone Idea's ability to continue as a going concern is highly dependent on a positive outcome on AGR matter before the Supreme Court for the payment in instalments. Next Supreme Court hearing on the AGR matter is scheduled in the third week of July. Favourable Supreme Court ruling, improvement in ARPU, reduction in loss of market share and any major investment by a big tech investor will be the key triggers for upside in the stock, " he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Share Market LIVE: Sensex rises 70 points, Nifty at 10,317; Axis Bank, BPCL, ITC top gainers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stocks in news: Vodafone Idea, Bank of Baroda, Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Godfrey Phillips, RITES, Marico and more&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bharti Airtel share gains over 2% as Carlyle to invest Rs 1,780 crore in telco's data centre arm&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>World Bank Provides $425 Million to Support the Provision of Infrastructure Financing in Eastern and Southern Africa</title>
            <link>https://indiaeducationdiary.in/world-bank-provides-425-million-to-support-the-provision-of-infrastructure-financing-in-eastern-and-southern-africa/</link>
            <description> New Delhi: The World Bank Board of Directors approved today a total amount of $425 million in International Development Association (IDA)* financing to support the provision of infrastructure finance in Eastern and Southern Africa. The Regional Infrastructure Financing Facility project (RIFF) aims to expand long-term finance to private firms in selected infrastructure in the power sector, as well as in the transport, logistics and social sectors. This is the first regional facility of this kind in Africa.&#60;p&#62; Eastern and Southern Africa suffers from ailing infrastructure, especially in the power sector. Effective power generation in the region is less than the installed capacity by 20-30 percent due to drought, lack of maintenance, and general system losses of electricity in both transmission and distribution. Such deficits cause about 2 percent loss of GDP growth in most of the countries, impeding a large number of the region's population from access to energy. Heavy public financing of infrastructure contributes to rising debt vulnerabilities and, before the outbreak of COVID-19, nearly half of the countries in the region were in debt distress.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The COVID-19 pandemic threatens the development gains made over the past years, said Ms. Deborah Wetzel, World Bank Director of Regional Integration for Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. The new operation will help address the long-term infrastructure funding gap through a regional approach focused on private financing, with the objective to mobilize about $975 million of private finance in addition to the funds provided by IDA. This requires a broader approach, including an enabling environment for private capital mobilization, sound public debt management, bankable projects, long-term finance, and risk mitigation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Through the Trade Development Bank (TDB) a commercially-driven regional development bank, the RIFF will provide long-term infrastructure finance that would contribute to job creation and would present cross-border benefits in terms of trade and investment flows or transfers of technology. It will facilitate access to debt financing for SMEs in infrastructure value chains and off-grid, by helping them to keep running and expanding to underserved markets. In the context of the COVID-19, the RIFF's focus on off-grid solar solutions will contribute to preserve households' livelihoods by supporting micro-entrepreneurial activities that play a critical role in income generation in poor communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Project harnesses a regional approach to address the financing needs of private sector infrastructure companies, by building capacity in regional institutions, TDB and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), to provide a longer and sustainable source of infrastructure finance and to support the enabling environment for infrastructure finance. Infrastructure is expected to be a key driver of economic recovery post COVID-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the first time IDA and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) the political risk insurance and credit enhancement arm of the World Bank Group are jointly supporting a regional development bank. MIGA is providing TDB a first-of-its-kind credit enhancement of EUR 334.4 million on a ten-year loan from private commercial banks, that will help TDB expand trade finance activities. The two operations are complementary and cover TDB's two main business lines (infrastructure finance and trade finance).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; * The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world's poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people's lives.

            <description> RITES Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.28 per cent decline in consolidated profit at Rs 143.93 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.&#60;p&#62;The railways consultancy firm had posted a consolidated profit of Rs 150.38 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal, it said in a regulatory filing to the BSE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Total revenue declined to Rs 614.24 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 789.19 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Total expenditure also declined to Rs 422.38 crore as against Rs 568.21 crore in the year-ago period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, for fiscal year 2019-20, profit rose 29.29 per cent to Rs 633.26 crore as against Rs 489.77 crore in 2018-19. The company, in a statement, said the revenue from subsidiary Railway Energy Management Company Ltd (REMCL) remained almost flat at Rs 81 crore against Rs 83 crore in the previous financial year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Revenue from REMCL got impacted in Q4 FY20 due to low demand from railways during lockdown and maintenance work for wind mills, it said. It said its wagon manufacturing joint venture, SAIL RITES Bengal Wagon Industry Private Limited (SRBWPL), achieved a profit of Rs 16 crore with revenue of Rs 265 crore during FY20.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The joint venture company produced and rehabilitated 1,066 wagons during the last financial year. Commenting on the results, RITES Ltd Chairman and Managing Director Rajeev Mehrotra said, "Notwithstanding the challenging business environment, I am pleased to share that our company has demonstrated sustained growth momentum across the segments during FY20 and again surpassed the revenue and profitability targets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Rolling stock exports remained our strategic growth area duly supported with Govt of India's 'Make in India' program. We achieved a major success by securing an export order of Rs 706 crore from Mozambique for cape gauge locomotives and coaches. We plan to develop products for standard gauge countries too," he added..&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Equalization Levy On Imports Of Solar Panels From SEZs Soon</title>
            <link>http://www.cleanfuture.co.in/2020/07/01/equalization-levy-on-imports-sezs/</link>
            <description> Indias plan to levy a customs duty on solar panels will be framed in a way that it does not severely hit domestic companies who operate from special economic zones, or SEZs.&#60;p&#62;Such zones are typically considered as foreign territories for import duty purposes. The government, hence, plans to charge a small equalization levy on imports of solar panels from factories based in such SEZs and run by Indian companies to sell to domestic customers, said the person requesting anonymity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This would be in lieu of the basic customs duty that is set to be levied on imports of solar components from other nations, mainly China and Malaysia.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Such a move will allow units based in SEZs to be competitive, compared to imports while selling to local customers, and at the same time, make a level-playing field for companies outside these zones who do not receive similar tax and other benefits.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India had set up these SEZs to boost exports and earn valuable foreign exchange. The plan to impose the tax on solar panel imports has, however, led companies based in these zones to approach the government to exclude them from it when they sell to domestic buyers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SEZ units say the tax incentives that initially helped them set up shop have dried up. Over the years, the tax benefits given to SEZs have diminished with these units having to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) from 2012.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Reference- livemint, Economic Times, Our Source&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Related&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Has 'Safeguard Duty'Done Any Good To Local Manufacturing?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The safeguard duty India imposed on solar cells and modules coming from China and Malaysia, which enjoyed 85-90% market share in the country, is just a few months away from completing its two-year course, and the government may have a tough time deciding whether to extend it or not.

            <description> The move, effective July 1, aims at improving environmental levels at WTE power plants and mitigating public discontent with stench and the risk of toxic emissions, such as dioxin&#60;p&#62;BEIJING: China will cut or suspend subsidy for waste-to-energy (WTE) power plants that violate emission standards, as part of its anti-pollution campaign, the country's finance and environment ministries said late on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The move, effective July 1, aims at improving environmental levels at WTE power plants and mitigating public discontent with stench and the risk of toxic emissions, such as dioxin.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) had rolled out a new regulation last year, forcing waste incinerators to reveal real-time emission and temperature data to the public as well as to upload it to the environmental bureau monitoring system.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government will cut or even suspend the subsidy for the WTE power generators that are found not revealing emission data or forging the data or not reaching the standards, according to the joint statement on Tuesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China has vowed to build waste incineration handling capacity of 591,400 tonnes per day by 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At end 2019, China had installed WTE power generation capacity of 12.02 gigawatts (GW) and daily incineration capacity of 490,000 tonnes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to China's Biomass Energy Association, the country is expected to add 2.9 GW WTE power generation capacity in 2020, requiring a subsidy of about 11.1 billion yuan ($1.57 billion).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, Beijing has been striving to curtail financial supports to renewable power sources in order to ease a backlog of subsidy payment exceeding 223 billion yuan, which may shadow the development of WTE projects in the pipeline.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Vodafone Idea share price slips 5% on Rs 11,644 crore Q4 loss</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/vodafone-idea-share-price-slips-5-on-rs-11-644-crore-q4-loss/ar-BB16bQDK</link>
            <description> Vodafone Idea share trades higher than 20, 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages but lower than 5-day moving averages. Market capitalisation of the telecom operator stood at Rs 29,654.92 crore as of today's session.&#60;p&#62; Vodafone Idea reported 6% revenue growth to Rs 11,089 crore on QoQ basis. "After several years of hyper-competition which led to unsustainable pricing, we increased prepaid tariffs at the start of December 2019 across all price points for both unlimited plans as well as combo vouchers. As a result, revenue for the quarter improved to Rs 11,750 crore, an increase of 6.0% QoQ," the company said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company's gross debt (excluding lease liabilities) as of March 31, 2020, was Rs 1,15,000 crore, including deferred spectrum payment obligations due to the government of Rs 87,650 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Keshav Lahoti, Associate Equity Analyst, Angel Broking said, "EBIDTA grew by 28.1% due to improvement in margins to 37.3% in Q4FY20 compared to 30.8% in Q3FY20. ARPU for Q4FY20 improved to Rs 121 against Rs 109 in Q3FY20, due to prepaid tariff hike effective from Dec'19. A further impact of tariff hikes in Dec'19 will flow in the coming months. Overall, Vodafone Idea's result was better than street estimates in terms of revenue, ARPU, EBIDTA and EBIDTA margins."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "Vodafone Idea's ability to continue as a going concern is highly dependent on a positive outcome on AGR matter before the Supreme Court for the payment in instalments. Next Supreme Court hearing on the AGR matter is scheduled in the third week of July. Favourable Supreme Court ruling, improvement in ARPU, reduction in loss of market share and any major investment by a big tech investor will be the key triggers for upside in the stock, " he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Share Market LIVE: Sensex rises 70 points, Nifty at 10,317; Axis Bank, BPCL, ITC top gainers&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Stocks in news: Vodafone Idea, Bank of Baroda, Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Godfrey Phillips, RITES, Marico and more&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bharti Airtel share gains over 2% as Carlyle to invest Rs 1,780 crore in telco's data centre arm&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Dem climate plan would end greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</title>
            <link>https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/dem-climate-plan-would-end-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050/76725706</link>
            <description> The new plan, put forth Tuesday in a 538-page report, offers similar goals but at a slower pace. It sets a range of targets, including a 45 per cent reduction by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming&#60;p&#62;WASHINGTON - House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a plan to address climate change that would set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while pushing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and addressing environmental contamination that disproportionately harms low-income and minority communities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The election-year plan backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders is less ambitious than a sweeping Green New Deal that a group of progressive Democrats outlined last year to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Green New Deal, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calls for dramatic steps to virtually eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 with a goal of meeting "100 per cent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources," including nuclear power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new plan, put forth Tuesday in a 538-page report, offers similar goals but at a slower pace. It sets a range of targets, including a 45 per cent reduction by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The plan also would require that by 2035 new cars emit no greenhouse gases, while heavy-duty trucks would eliminate those emissions by 2040. The plan would eliminate overall emissions from the power sector by 2040 and all but eliminate greenhouse emissions from all economic sectors by 2050.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Supporters say the plan, presented by Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, by 2050 would save more than 60,000 American lives every year thanks to reduced air pollution, as well as nearly $8 trillion thanks to health and climate benefits.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"Democrats know the climate crisis is the essential crisis of our time, threatening public health, jobs and the economy, national security and values,'' Pelosi said Tuesday at a Capitol news conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We are here today to provide hope and vision,'' said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chairwoman of the climate panel. She called the Democratic plan a "transformative road map for solving the climate crisis,'' and pledged it would address environmental justice and vulnerable communities that are suffering from the effects of air and water pollution and industrial waste.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The health of our families and the air we breathe are at the heart of our plan,'' Castor said, adding that it would create good-paying jobs in solar and wind energy, manufacturing electric vehicles and ensuring that communities are more resilient to flooding, extreme heat, intense hurricanes and wildfires.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While likely to win approval in the Democratic-controlled House, the plan faces insurmountable opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats are hoping to make inaction on climate change by congressional Republicans and the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Trump administration a key campaign issue in November's election.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;GOP lawmakers immediately slammed the plan as a job-killer. The Democratic plan "punishes the American economy" and "gives a free pass to China" to pollute, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have expanded responsible, clean-energy technologies "while the Democrats continue to push radical Green New Deal-like polices that would cripple America's economy and crush the poorest communities across the globe," said White House spokesman Judd Deere.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Democratic plan is similar to one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Biden's plan also sets a goal for net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and pledges an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than 2025.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A Biden spokesman applauded Pelosi and House Democrats and said that as president, Biden "will work with Congress to implement a bold agenda that addresses the climate emergency, achieves environmental justice and creates good-paying jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new plan received immediate support from more than 90 outside organizations, including major environmental groups and leaders in environmental justice, agriculture, public health and transportation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Sunrise Movement, a progressive group that helped develop the Green New Deal, said the plan did not go far enough, fast enough to halt climate change.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This plan is more ambitious than anything we have seen from Democratic leadership so far, but it still needs to go further to match the full scale of the crisis,'' said Lauren Maunus, the group's legislative manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"There's nothing to lose by going bigger,'' Maunus said."Taking action at the scale of the crisis will help lift our economy out of recession and put millions of people back to work building a more just and resilient society.''&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a sign of the changed political environment, the Democratic plan heavily emphasizes environmental justice and notes that the report's release comes as the nation is reeling from a cascade of crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. which has killed more than 120,000 Americans; stay-at-home orders and business closures that have put 40 million Americans out of work; and nationwide protests in response to the police killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Throughout these crises, Trump has "failed to lead the country in a unified and compassionate response, instead choosing to fan the flames of discord and distrust,'' the report said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, lead author of a 2018 report on climate change for the United Nations, said the House committee's report got the science correct. "If you want to keep temperatures low, we need to act quickly. The emission cuts required are really quite dramatic, as they say here," Mahowald said in an email.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann called the report "an excellent starting point" that offers a sensible mix of subsidies for renewable energy and a price on carbon emissions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The report was released as the Trump administration pushed a plan to spur production of fossil fuels even higher. In a 56-page report that did not mention the word "climate,'' the Energy Department on Tuesday urged building up four Appalachian states as a petrochemical production and manufacturing hub, while delaying market-driven retirements of the region's coal plants. The four targeted states - Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky - are the heart of Appalachian energy production. Pennsylvania is a key battleground in the 2020 election, and recent polls show Biden narrowly leading Trump in Ohio.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Trump has mocked the science of climate change, and his administration has dismantled Obama-era initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while throwing a series of financial and regulatory breaks to the coal, oil and gas sectors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>COVID-19 Update: MNRE Issues Clarification On Time Extension for RE Projects</title>
            <link>https://solarquarter.com/2020/07/01/covid-19-update-mnre-issues-clarification-on-time-extension-for-re-projects/</link>
            <description> The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( MNRE ), nodal Ministry of the Government of India has recently passed an order on Time-Extension for Renewable Energy (RE) Projects considering disruption due to COVID-19 Lockdown.&#60;p&#62;On order dated 17.04.2020 MNRE had directed all RE implementing agencies of the MNRE to treat lockdown due to COVID-19, as Force Majeure and that they may grant an extension of time for RE projects equivalent to the period of lockdown and additional 30 days for normalization after the end of such lockdown. States and UTs were also requested to treat Lockdown as Force Majeure and to consider granting appropriate time extension on account of such lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MNRE clarifies that In line with the Ministry of Home Affairs on orders dated 15th April, 17th May, and 30th May 2020, the period of lockdown is to be treated from 25th March 2020 to 31st May 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All projects through RE Implementing agencies designated by the MNRE and the projects under various schemes of the MNRE are covered under the said OM.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The timelines for intermediate milestones of a project may also be extended within the extended time, the ministry added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Developers of the projects are directed to pass on the benefit of such time-extension, by way of granting similar time-extensions, to other stakeholders down the value chain like Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contractors, material! equipment suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), etc.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The following order was passed with the approval of the Ministry of NRE &#38; Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MNRE earlier on 20.03.2020, issued directions to SECI, NTPC, and Addl. Chief Secretaries / Pr. Secretaries / Secretaries of Power / Energy / Renewable Energy (RE) Departments of State Governments/ UT Govts./ Administrations, to treat delay on account of disruption of the supply chains due to spread of coronavirus in China or any other country, as Force Majeure and that they may grant a suitable extension of time for projects, on account of coronavirus, based on evidence/documents produced by developers in support of their respective claims of such disruption of the supply chains due to spread of coronavirus in China or any other country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T's Naik says'was apprehensive' about bidding for ITER's cryostat contract</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111854-lts-naik-says-was-apprehensive-about-bidding-for-iters-cryostat-contract</link>
            <description> Larsen &#38; Toubro non-executive chairman A M Naik on Tuesday said he was "apprehensive" about bidding for Rs 1,338-crore ITER's cryostat contract&#60;p&#62;for the world's largest experimental thermo-nuclear fusion reactor in France as it was considered as "too risky" a bet. The company, which bagged the contract in 2012 from ITER&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India, a wing of Department of Atomic Energy, to manufacture and install the cryostat, on Tuesday flagged off the last delivery of top lid sectors of the cryostat to the facility in France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Naik, who had joined the flag off ceremony through a virtual platform, recollected the days of 2011 when he was in doubt whether the company should bid for the project or not. "At the time when we were quoting in 2011, this project was perceived by L&#38;T and by me in particular...if you want to call me a culprit...as a risk. The contract included construction of large temporary workshops in France within two years of award of contract with capacity of 200 MT and I was very worried about how we would be able to work in France when we have not even dealt with a single French worker," Naik said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Elaborating on the same, he said that carrying out manufacturing activities in a temporary workshop for five years under very difficult labour laws, long-term exposure to foreign exchange risk, risk associated on the funding side in the multi-nation project and potential chances of technology delays made it a risky bet. "L&#38;T's management bandwidth and teams executing such an enormous project and that too far from India..this we have never done nor had done before. Hence the project was perceived to be too risky," Naik added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 650 MT cryostat assembly, referred to as the Top Lid, is to be installed with other Cryostat segments for ITER in a reactor pit at the project in southern France's Provence. L&#38;T has delivered the lower cylinder of the Cryostat in March 2019 and upper cylinder in March this year. After this delivery, the only part of the contract remaining is to integrate the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Cryostat with the Tokamak Reactor building. The Cryostat's function is to provide cooling to the fusion reactor and to keep very high temperatures at its core under control. The ITER thermonuclear fusion reactor has been designed to create a plasma of 500 megawatts (thermal) for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a ten-fold gain of plasma heating power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If successful, it will demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma. The European Union, along with six other countries including India and the US, is carrying out the USD 14.5 billion project targeted to be commissioned in 2025. It involves the construction of one of the largest fusion reactors built since the 1950s.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Naik said that he had sent back the proposal four times when it had come for his approval before ultimately giving the go-ahead to participate in the bidding process. "What started with a lot of apprehension is coming out as a glorious inning of the last 8 years and another 4-5 years to go as a participant in the world's unique project," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also thanked L&#38;T Heavy Engineering Executive Vice President and Head, Anil Parab and former L&#38;T whole-time director and president of Heavy Engineering division MV Kotwal for convincing him and ensuring that the project, a pride for both L&#38;T and India, got executed. Speaking at the event, L&#38;T's Chief Executive and MD S N Subrahmanyan said, "The company has completed another milestone in the development of the world's largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company has used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER."He further said this development will further pave a way for the installation of Cryostat at the project site in&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;France and eventually lead to the demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power..&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Maharashtra power min asks Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk for grievance redressal</title>

            <description> MERC has also asked the utilities to provide the option of easy monthly instalments (EMI) and directed them to not disconnect power supply over non-payment of dues until grievances are redressed&#60;p&#62;Mumbai: Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut has asked state-owned Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk to address consumers' grievances after state electricity regulator MERC supported the utilities saying the bills charged by the discoms were as per the rules. Following the consumers' complaints over inflated bills in June, MERC had sought clarification from the discoms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), later observed that the discoms had followed the rules of "practise direction".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The present bills raised on actual meter readings are of the summer months where the consumption is normally high and the bills are always of higher amounts. Hence the balance amount payable after adjusting the average bill amounts for each of the three months March, April and May have led to higher bill that was issued in June," it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;MERC has also asked the utilities to provide the option of easy monthly instalments (EMI) and directed them to not disconnect power supply over non-payment of dues until grievances are redressed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Raut directed Mahadiscom to set up helpdesk at divisional levels and also take initiatives to spread awareness among customers about the billing process by reaching out through various platforms like TV, radio, webinar and Facebook, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The state discom has decided to allow EMI option for three months for making the payment of the bill for June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Raut also asked the discom to grant a discount of two per cent to consumers who have promptly paid the bills for June as well as for those who would be paying the bill amount in lump sum.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also, those who had left for their villages during the lockdown period but have paid the bills for the three months on estimated basis, would get a refund in case they have paid extra amount.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Many consumers, including celebrities like Taapsee Pannu, Huma Qureshi, director Bijoy Nambiar and Renuka Shahane, took to Twitter to express concerns over the unexpected rise in their electricity bills during the lockdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to MERC, all these utilities have dropped tariffs after the commission's revision order from April 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, since the country went into lockdown from March 25, following the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID outbreak, the bills were calculated as per the previous readings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Adani Electricity reduced 12 per cent power tariff for all categories, followed by Tata Power (10 per cent), Mahadiscom (five per cent) and BEST (one per cent).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to MERC, only 6.35 lakh consumers across state were billed on actual meter readings during the lockdown, which is nearly 2.32 per cent of the total consumer base in the state.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, MERC has already approved installation of 7 lakh meters for Adani and 66,000 meters for Tata Power, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Follow and connect with us on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>GCL System Integration Supports Floating Solar Power Plant in Persian Gulf</title>
            <link>https://www.energetica-india.net/news/gcl-system-integration-supports-floating-solar-power-plant-in-persian-gulf</link>
            <description> Research by the IHS Markit's Floating PV Report 2020 discloses lately that the floating solar power installations are set to jump by 143% from 2019 to hit more than 900 MW of annual capacity additions this year. GCL System Integration (GCL SI), is poised to lead this high growth segment by enhancing its presence in floating solar farm sector. Most recently the company has just announced its line of completely waterproof solar panels have been instrumental in the development of a floating solar power plant off the coast of Nurai Island in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&#60;p&#62;Located near the luxury resort island of Nurai, local solar developer, Enerwhere has constructed the first floating solar power plant on seawater in the Middle East using GCL SI's patented dual-glass solar modules. Aside from the solar panels, the ambitious project was made possible through using floating and mounting structures built by Sungrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although the concept of floating solar is ideal for space saving, in practice, it is very challenging. GCL SI's patented dual-glass modules are specifically designed for marine application and can withstand over 30 years of constant salt spray. In order to last decades, the modules need to be absolutely waterproof and resistant to the potential harsh weather conditions experienced in the open ocean. GCL SI dual-glass modules all passed rigorous IEC tests for harsh environment like salt mist, ammonia corrosion and sand blowing. As the evidence of GCL SI modules'high quality performance and reliability especially when used in open water. Enerwhere's choice of GCL SI produced solar modules is adding another milestone to the GCL's existing portfolio including 4 floating solar projects around the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Spearheaded by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), the UAE is committed to the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, a plan to transform Dubai into a global clean energy center by 2050 with 75% of electricity coming from clean energy including solar. To achieve this, the government intends to build a "solar lake" of floating solar panels in the Emirate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The life-cycle of solar module is one of the key factors in ensuring the sustainability and profitability of PV projects. With durability as its priority, GCL has been pioneering the technologies to increase the lifespan of its solar modules, lowering the cost of per unit of electricity for investors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://sourcinghardware.net/2020/07/01/corona-containment-reforms-will-recover-economy-niti-aayogs-rajiv-kumar/</link>
            <description> The countrys economy will witness a recovery after the containment of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the ongoing reforms directed at keeping Indias growth rate ahead of peers, PTI has reported Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar as saying.&#60;p&#62;Indias economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indias strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the countrys growth rate ahead of peers, he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Kumars observation has come on the heels of IMFs projection that showed a sharp contraction of 4.5% for the countrys growth this year, citing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that has impeded all economic activities, but had also expected India to bounce back next year with a robust 6% growth rate. Also, many economists, brokerages and MNC agencies have said that India will witness a deep contraction in the face of the strict lockdown to control the spread Covid-19.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Why state-owned electricity firms are under a cloud in power-surplus Punjab</title>

            <description> The Punjab govt's decision to redevelop the land on which its oldest power plant, shut down in 2018, stands has brought out old concerns.&#60;p&#62;The Punjab govt's decision to redevelop the plot of the Guru Nanak Dev thermal power plant in Bathinda, which was de-commissioned in 2018, has stoked fresh controversy | Photo courtesy: @HarsimratBadal_&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chandigarh: Former employees of Punjabs state-owned Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Power Plant in Bathinda staged a major protest last week against the governments decision to redevelop and sell the land on which it is built.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The plant is the oldest in this state, with its first unit commissioned in the 1970s. But it was shut down in January 2018 amid the state governments efforts to phase out thermal power plants older than 25 years over emission-related concerns, in line with central government guidelines. Its employees were accommodated at other plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the governments redevelopment plan for the 1,764-acre plot has brought out longstanding concerns among several sections about what is seen as the administrations abandonment of state-owned plants in favour of private players.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Despite being a power-surplus state, Punjab has among the highest electricity charges in the country, at Rs 8.37 per unit for domestic users. The high charges have often been attributed, among other factors, to the agreements signed by the erstwhile Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to allow private players to set up plants in Punjab.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The agreements call on the government to pay a fixed charge to the players whether or not it purchases any electricity from them. This, experts say, has led the government to buy power from private players to rationalise this payment  said to be totalling Rs 4,000 crore a year  often at the cost of state-run plants, where production is allegedly dwindling.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This has led to concerns among employees of state-run plants about the longevity of their jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In 2017, the Congress came to office in the state with a promise to renegotiate the agreements and restore the Bathinda plant. The Amarinder Singh government promised a white paper this January to expose the alleged fraud in the agreements.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But even the Congress has come under fire for doing nothing to address the problems plaguing the plants, despite making the alleged fraud in the agreements a campaign issue.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also Read: Another fight brewing as Punjab demands Haryana gives it more space in Vidhan Sabha building&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Punjabs state-owned thermal power plants include one at Ropar, which has four units with the capacity to generate 210 MW each. Initially, it had six units, but two were de-commissioned along with the Bathinda power plant. Its first unit was commissioned in 1984 and the last in 1993.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The other government-run power plant stands at Lehra Mohabbat, which has two units of 210 MW each, commissioned in 1997-98, and two units of 250 MW each, commissioned in 2008.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With these two plants, the governments power generation capacity is 1,760 MW. Both plants are run by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There are three private thermal plants in the state with a combined capacity of 3,920 MW. One of them, commissioned at Rajpura in 2014, has two units of 700 MW each. The second plant, functioning since 2013 at Talwandi Sabo, has three units of 660 MW each. The third plant is located at Goindwal Sahib  it was also commissioned in 2013 and has two units of 270 MW each.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Apart from this, the state can produce 1,300 MW through renewable sources of energy  hydro, solar and biomass  taking Punjabs total power generation capacity to 7,000 MW.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Vinod Kumar Gupta, spokesperson of the All India Power Engineers Federation, a nationwide union, Punjab produces more power than it consumes for eight months of the year. The peak season lasts four months in the summer when paddy is sown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Punjab is power-surplus and the entire demand is being met by private thermal plants. Punjabs own power plants were commissioned much before the private players came in. But the government prefers to buy power from private plants because it is paying them fixed charges, Gupta said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This faulty clause is the reason that, one by one, the governments own power plants will close down in the manner that the Bathinda plant was shut down, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Punjab, Gupta said, often struggled to find buyers for its excess power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although Punjab banks power with other states during low- consumption months and also tries to sell it, but with so many power plants coming up across the country, the demand for power per se has gone down, he added. Also, the rate at which Punjab is ready to sell power is higher than what is generally available to other states from the exchange (national grid, which facilitates exchange of electricity around India ).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a result, say insiders, including those within the government, the two state-run thermal plants are used to generate power for less than 30 days in a year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Gupta said the adverse implications of setting up private thermal plants in the state have already come to the fore as the plant load factor (a performance parameter) of the governments thermal facilities has already dipped to abnormally low levels.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Punjab is neither able to consume power within the state nor sell power to others outside, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There are apprehensions that government plants will remain on forced shutdown to pave way for private sector generation, said Gupta.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A top officer in the PSPCL acknowledged these concerns. Following the sharp dip in the demand for power during the lockdown, the possibility of the governments own power plants becoming functional has become almost nil, the officer said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the past few months, the power plant at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat have run for barely 15 days.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, A. Venu Prasad, the chairman cum managing director of the PSPCL, made light of worries about the government-run plants imminent shutdown.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said there is no proposal whatsoever to decommission any of the governments thermal plants. The employees working in these plants need not fear losing jobs, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Offshore Wind Energy Market to Hit 23 GW Installation Capacity by 2026: Global Market Insights</title>
            <link>https://www.energetica-india.net/news/offshore-wind-energy-market-to-hit-23-gw-installation-capacity-by-2026-global-market-insights</link>
            <description> According to the latest report "Offshore Wind Energy Market by Component by Global Market Insights, Inc., the market valuation of offshore wind will cross $75 billion by 2026.&#60;p&#62;The offshore wind energy market will grow substantially on account of surging electricity demand, coupled with the ongoing transition toward clean energy technologies. The implementation of stringent emission mandates and regulations introduced by respective governments and policymakers toward the combustion of conventional fuels will further augment the market growth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Rising efforts toward increasing the overall system efficiency, along with surging installations of offshore wind projects, will propel the integration of advanced electrical components and infrastructure. High operational efficiency and ongoing digitalization are a few eminent factors stimulating product demand. In addition, high investor inclination toward the financing of utility scale projects will further influence the segment growth.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The global offshore wind energy market from &#62;30  50 m depth segment will witness over a 16% growth from 2020 to 2026. Ongoing saturation of nearshore sites, along with growing demand for high operational CUF for offshore projects, will drive the industry growth. Ongoing advancements in installation capabilities and availability of high wind speeds far from shore are prominent factors favoring the deployment of offshore platforms at higher depth levels.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Supportive regulatory framework and government policies and mandates, along with the rapidly declining process for wind turbines will boost the North America offshore wind energy market growth. North America, led by the U.S., is still considered as an emerging market for the offshore wind industry. As per the Department of Energy, the technical potential available across shallow water depths and the eastern seaboard may host 530 GW of wind energy and has the capability of covering over 40% of the country's current electricity generation capacity in the coming years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Chinese EV startup Byton to suspend production from July 1 for reorganisation</title>
            <link>https://businessfortnight.com/can/evnt/click.htm?r=YjM1MTc1NTUtYjZjMi00YWI3LTk2M2UtYWQzZTZkYjdmYTU1LTZuMTA6MzQyNTQ1Ojluajo0NTg0NDE4OTo2OjU1MDI1MDQ6NDc4NzowOjA6MC4wOjA6MTowOjgwMzIxOjA6OjoxOjEwOS4yMzkuMjI5LjIwMzpNb3ppbGxhLzUuMCAoWDExOyBMaW51eCB4ODZfNjQpIEFw</link>
            <description> By Ravindra Soni SHANGHAI: China-based electric car startup Byton said on Tuesday it will suspend production from July 1 to conduct a reorganization of the firm after being hit by the coronavirus pandemic.&#60;p&#62; The company, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, said it was also actively raising funds to address issues relating to unpaid staff salaries and that it hoped to start paying employees from July.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "The new coronavirus epidemic has brought great challenges to Byton 's financing and production operations," it said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; "After careful consideration and joint consultations with our shareholders and management, we have decided to, from July 1, kickstart a plan to lower employee costs and promote the company's strategic reorganization," it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Byton produces all of its vehicles at a plant in Nanjing. From Wednesday it will suspend most operations in China, where its activities include research and development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The company is among a series of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturing startups that have emerged in recent years to challenge foreign companies like Tesla Inc. China, which has been eager to curb smog and spur its own auto industry, has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) to account for 25% of auto sales by 2025, up from around 5% currently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But appetite to fund such startups began falling last year and has been dealt a further, heavy blow by the coronavirus pandemic, leaving a number fighting to survive.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In May, sales of NEVs fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, China's largest auto industry association said. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In April, industry website Electrek reported that Byton had put hundreds of employees from its Santa Clara facility in California on furlough.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Byton was launched in September 2017 by Future Mobility Corp, a company co-founded by former BMW and Nissan Motor executives, and also has software and design facilities in the United States and Germany.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; From around the web&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Customs to clear pharma raw materials from China</title>
            <link>https://www.rediff.com/business/report/customs-to-clear-pharma-raw-materials-from-china/20200701.htm</link>
            <description> Apart from them, consignments of 11 top importers, including LG, Samsung, Toyota, Honda, and Siemens, will also be allowed entry, relieving them of the 100 per cent inspection rule.&#60;p&#62;Image used for representational purpose. Photograph: PTI Photo.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Easing restrictions on imports from China, the customs department has decided to clear pharma raw material shipments from that country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consignments of 11 top importers, including LG, Samsung, Toyota, Honda, and Siemens, will also be allowed entry, relieving them of the 100 per cent inspection rule.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This comes after a week of economic disruption caused by introducing stringent scrutiny, resulting in shipments originating in China getting held up at Indian ports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After representations from industry bodies, the government on Tuesday cleared imports of active pharma ingredients (APIs) from China. Besides, the top importers falling within the Tier 3 category of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme were given exemption from stringent scrutiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Imports of APIs and shipments from AEO T3 importers have been exempt from the 100 per cent check. The Indian pharma industry is heavily dependent on API imports from China and they were facing a huge shortage of raw material. Besides, the tier 3 AEOs are the top importers who meet the highest level of compliance, so they have been given the relaxation, said a government official.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He said these shipments would get moving from Wednesday. Over 60 per cent of APIs used in India come from China. On June 22, Customs officials in Chennai and Vizag were asked to put all shipments from China on hold until further orders. This was done on the basis of intelligence inputs about illegal imports of narcotics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Informal instructions were given to all ports and airports to do 100 per cent physical checks of shipments originating in China. Bilateral trade between China and India was worth $88 billion in FY19, with a deficit of $53.5 billion in Chinas favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India is also heavily dependent on China for intermediates and key starting material (KSM) for making drugs. This dependence has grown over the years as local manufacturers have moved to high-margin products (after they could not expand freely due to pollution norms) and Chinese APIs are 30 per cent cheaper than domestic stuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The country mostly imports APIs and intermediates for vitamins (like Vitamin C), common antibiotics, and metformin (diabetes) from China. The government has now drawn up a plan to reduce dependence on the country by incentivising the local production of APIs through production-linked incentives (PLI) of up to Rs 10 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The government has identified 41 products (molecules), covering 53 crucial APIs, for which India is dependent on China. Almost 80 per cent of the 41 are intermediates. In 2016, the customs department had launched the Authorised Economic Operator, or AEO, scheme.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is a voluntary programme, under which an importer gets preferential treatment from customs for being compliant with supply-chain security standards. AEOs get benefits like fast-tracking shipments, deferred payments, exemption from issuing guarantees, and preferential treatment from customs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They are classified into three categories -- T1, T2, and T3 -- with T3 representing the highest level of compliance. Of the more than 3,000 AEOs, only 11 are in the T3 category.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the government is planning to curtail imports of at least 300 non-essential items from China, either through duty hikes and imposing non-tariff barriers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/spain-aims-to-reform-electricity-law-by-year-end-deputy-pm-says</link>
            <description> (Bloomberg) -- Spain aims to introduce legislation by the end of the year to help the European Union's fourth biggest economy make a green transition.&#60;p&#62; The government in Madrid is seeking to modify how power prices are set and is weighing different price-setting methodologies, according to Deputy Prime Minister Teresa Ribera, who oversees energy policy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Spain's power market is struggling as electricity prices decline due to a combination of cheaper clean energy, lower demand due to the economic crisis and cheaper oil and gas. That poses a problem for the government, as power bills include many fixed-costs used to maintain the grid -- such as special payments made at certain times to large industrial consumers or compensation to generators for keeping idle plants.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; We are looking at different ways to set prices: power purchase agreements, pools, auctions with fixed prices, Ribera said in an interview with Bloomberg last week, adding that the law reform plan is quite advanced. This must all be done while also deciding how to cover the power system's fixed costs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Spain is among the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with its economy forecast to shrink by as much as 15% this year and unemployment seen surpassing 18%. Debt is set to balloon as the government puts in place a number of aid programs but the country could also access as much of 140 billion euros ($157 million) in European Union aide.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investor demand for Spanish renewable energy has boomed in recent years as the country pushes to meet European clean energy targets. Last week the government approved a decree to streamline permits for new projects, as it seeks to make renewables account for 74% of overall power by 2030.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Ribera, who also serves as ecological transition minister, is also focused on helping the nation move its fossil fuel-based industry into the electric vehicle era.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Spain is quite behind in electric mobility, Ribera said. We are going to need to attract a kind of industrial company that's different from car firms, because car firms make their innovation bets in their headquarters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Before the crisis, carmakers in the country were assembling five or six different models of plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles in Spain and had plans to increase that to up to 18 within the next two years, Ribera said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When the crisis imploded, the market became zero, Ribera said. Carmakers were left with stocks of vehicles they couldn't sell, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The government reacted swiftly to ensure a recovery of industrial activity, Ribera said, in a reference to a plan announced earlier this month for the sector. Unlike Germany, which didn't include any aid to fossil fuel vehicles in its own recovery package, Spain will allow consumers to replace their old cars with newer diesel and gasoline models.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The aide package will act as a hinge between the old and new industries, helping companies sell their old stock and signaling to auto firms that the Spanish industry's future is electric, she said. The government also wants to limit public aid to fossil fuel-based companies through a climate change bill that has not yet been passed by congress.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is probably the last time we will see aid to the combustion engine, Ribera said. Our mobility is going in a different direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#194;&#169;2020 Bloomberg L.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bloomberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Missing BloombergQuint's WhatsApp service?

            <title>India: SoftBank-backed SBG Cleantech in talks with Brookfield to raise up to $600m</title>
            <link>https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/sbg-cleantech-brookfield-195247/</link>
            <description> Renewable energy/Illustration/ Internet Archive SBG Cleantech, a renewable energy joint venture (JV) between Japanese behemoth SoftBank Group and Indias Bharti Enterprises, is in talks with Canadian investment fund Brookfield to raise $500-600 million, per a report by The Economic Times.&#60;p&#62;Softbank owns a majority of 80 per cent stake in the JV company, while the remaining is held by the Indian multinational.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Negotiations are currently underway to finalise the deal structure that is expected to be a combination of mezzanine debt and equity, the report added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The proposed funding will be used by SBG Cleantech to expedite its ongoing and future projects in India and the US.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We at DealStreetAsia had reported about the development in May stating that SBG Cleantech has reached out to a gamut of investors&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; both financial and strategic  to raise close to $750 million.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the pipeline, the company currently has projects worth 7.7-gigawatt in India, which it plans to take up to 20-gigawatt over the next five years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SB Energy, the renewable energy arm of SoftBank, is understood to have roped in Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays to facilitate the fundraising process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SBG Cleantech has assets in diverse markets such as the US, Latin America and Middle East, besides holding operating assets in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Investors are increasingly evincing interest in Indias renewable energy sector as its share has been going up in the countrys power sector. Going forward, the sector is expected to witness even more traction as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently paved the way for privatisation of electricity distribution companies (discoms) in all eight union territories.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Some of the companies that have raised funding starting 2019 in India are Greenko Energy Holdings, ReNew Power, and Adani Green energy, among others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Infineon Adds 62 mm Device to its Cool SiC MOSFET 1200 V Family</title>
            <link>https://www.bisinfotech.com/infineon-adds-62-mm-device-to-its-cool-sic-mosfet-1200-v-family/</link>
            <description> Infineon Technologies has added another industry standard package to its CoolSiC MOSFET 1200 V module family. The proven 62 mm device has been designed in half-bridge topology and is based on the trench chip technology.&#60;p&#62;It opens up silicon carbide for applications in the medium power range starting at 250 kW  where silicon reaches the limits of power density with IGBT technology. Compared to a 62 mm IGBT module, the list of applications now additionally includes solar, server, energy storage, EV charger, traction, commercial induction cooking and power conversion systems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 62 mm module features Infineons CoolSiC MOSFETs, which enable a high current density. Very low switching and conducting losses minimize cooling efforts, whereas operating the device at high switching frequency allows for using smaller magnetic components. By implementing Infineons CoolSiC chip technology, it is possible to design smaller inverter designs for the application in terms of size, overall system costs can be reduced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With a base plate and screw connections, the housing is characterized by a very robust mechanical design, which is optimized for highest system availability, a minimum of service cost and off-time losses. The outstanding reliability is made possible by high thermal cycling capability and a continuous operating temperature (T ) of 150&#194;&#176;C. The symmetrical internal design of the housing allows identical switching conditions for the upper and lower switch. As an option, the thermal performance of the module can be improved even further with pre-applied thermal interface Material (TIM).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Availability&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The CoolSiC MOSFETs 1200 V in the 62 mm package come in variants of 6 m/250 A, 3 m/357 A, and 2 m/500 A respectively. Designed for fast characterization (double pulse/continuous operation), an evaluation board is available for the devices. For ease of use, it offers a flexible adjustment of the gate voltage and gate resistors. At the same time, it can serve as a reference design for driver boards for series production.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Six killed, 17 injured in boiler blast at TN's Neyveli thermal power plant</title>
            <link>https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/six-killed-17-injured-boiler-blast-tns-neyveli-thermal-power-plant-127707</link>
            <description> Six employees belonging to the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) were killed and 12 critically injured in a boiler blast on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62; According to the police, the blast happened around 10 am on Wednesday in the second thermal power plant. Pictures from the accident site show plumes of smoke billowing from one of the boilers in the plant.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Six employees died on the spot and 17 have been injured. At least 12 have been referred to Apollo Hospital in Chennai while five employees are being treated at the hospital inside the premises. Two more employees are believed to be trapped inside the boiler and efforts are on to rescue them, the police officer told TNM.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; An employee of the power plant told TNM that the blast had occurred between 10.30 am and 11 am in unit 5 of the second phase of the plant. We think that this could have happened because of pressure build-up inside the boiler. There is a chance of setting the wrong pressure to the boiler operations and that could have caused it, the employee said, requesting anonymity. He also added that two units are currently not producing power and hence the staff on duty might have adjusted the pressure to this boiler to compensate for the loss of production in the other units.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the second such blast that has happened in the last three months in the second phase of the plant. In April, a boiler in unit 6 had exploded and four employees were killed in the blast and four other sustained injuries. According to a report , in June 2019, one person was killed and two others sustained grievous injuries after a safety valve exploded in one of the units in the second phase of the power plant.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; An official from the NLC, however, said only two employees were confirmed dead, with four others still missing'.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The unit was shut down last night and they were trying to start the unit this morning when the incident occurred. The explosion occurred at the 32-metre level of the boiler. The Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) personnel have cordoned off the area and are looking for four people who are missing, the official stated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Thermal Power Plant-2 is a 1,470 MW facility and has seven 210 MW units currently generating 450 MW power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (This is a developing story)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Capital infusion of Rs 392 crore by promoters, key shareholder and various stakeholders demonstrates their commitment and confidence in Suzlon," Group CEO J P Chalasani said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Under the debt restructuring, the Persons Acting in Concert (PACs) with promoters of Suzlon Energy Ltd (SEL) have acquired 20,40,77,000 fully paid-up equity shares of SEL and and 4,998 fully paid up Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) at par representing 20,39,98,368 equity shares.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The PACs along with the promoters of Suzlon Energy have acquired the said shares having a face value of Rs two each for cash at an issue price of Rs 2.45 per equity share and 4,998 fully paid up CCDs having a face value of Rs 1 lakh each for cash at par representing over 20.39 crore equity shares of Rs two each, it said in another regulatory filing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides Tanti Holdings Private Ltd, an entity forming part of the promoter/promoter group of SEL has acquired, by way of preferential allotment, 40,80,77,000 fully paid-up equity shares of SEL having a face value of Rs two each for cash at an issue price of Rs 2.45 per equity share.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"This debt restructuring will ease the pressure on our cash flows significantly and give us headroom for ramping up business operations," Swapnil Jain, CFO, said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Jain further said "we have reduced our fixed cost steeply and brought down the interest costs by more than per cent. This has resulted in substantial reduction in the break-even point from pre-restructuring levels ensuring a long term sustainable business case. It improves our overall competitiveness in the market place and now Suzlon is back to business from a position of strength." PTI KKS DRR DRR&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Key barometers extended gains and hit the day's high in afternoon trade. At 13:25 IST, the barometer index, the S&#38;P BSE Sensex, was gained 452.89 points or 1.3% at 35,368.69. The Nifty 50 index added 113.15 points or 1.1% at 10,415.25.&#60;p&#62;In the broader market, the S&#38;P BSE Mid-Cap index was up 0.02% while the S&#38;P BSE Small-Cap index gained 0.44%.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The market breadth was positive. On the BSE, 1395 shares rose and 1244 shares fell. A total of 115 shares were unchanged. In Nifty 50 index, 31 stocks advanced and 19 stocks declined.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;COVID-19 Update:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Total COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide stood at 1,04,77,554 far with 5,11,300 deaths.

Despite the rise, the latest reading pointed to a third successive monthly decline in the health of the manufacturing sector, albeit one that was far softer than registered in April and May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Commenting on the latest survey results, Eliot Kerr, Economist at IHS Markit, said: "India's manufacturing sector moved towards stabilisation in June, with both output and new orders contracting at much softer rates than seen in April and May. However, the recent spike in new coronavirus cases and the resulting lockdown extensions have seen demand continue to weaken."Should case numbers continue rising at their current pace, further lockdown extensions may be imposed, which would likely derail a recovery in economic conditions and prolong the woes of those most severely affected by this crisis."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Gainers &#38; Losers:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Axis Bank (up 4.96%), UPL (up 4.35%), HDFC (up 4.2%), IndusInd Bank (up 3.69%) and Bajaj Finserv (up 3.63%) were top gainers in Nifty 50 index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;NTPC (down 2.6%), Nestle (down 2.36%), Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 2.12%), Cipla (down 1.94%) and L&#38;T (down 1.9%) were top losers in Nifty 50 index.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Earnings Impact:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ONGC fell 1.90% to Rs 79.85 after the PSU company posted a standalone net loss of Rs 3,098.26 crore in the fourth quarter.

German stocks were impacted by technical issues on the DAX index, causing volumes to lag.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;China's Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI in June came in at 51,2, against previous month's reading of 50.7. PMI readings above 50 signify expansion, while those below that indicate contraction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The US stock market finished session higher on last session of the month and quarter, Tuesday, 30 June 2020, as the investors risk sentiments boosted up with better than expected domestic economic data which helping to offset concerns over the health of the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. The Conference Board released a report showed a bigger than expected improvement in consumer confidence in the month of June. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 98.1 in June from a downwardly revised 85.9 in May.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Stocks gains were also supported by the testimony of the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's to the House Financial Services Committee regarding the response to the coronavirus pandemic. Mnuchin said the Treasury and Fed were looking at extending the Fed's established 11 emergency lending facilities to include asset-based lending markets, but also reiterated that additional types of COVID-19 aid likely will need to be addressed by Congress under the next phase of stimulus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Powell emphasized that the overriding goal' of the central bank's facilities is to help get the roughly 25 million workers who lost jobs during the pandemic back to work, while also warning that a second wave of COVID-19 infections could undermine consumer confidence again.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coronavirus cases continued to climb in multiple US states, leading to new restrictions and rollbacks of reopening phases. States such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona have rolled back reopening plans and imposed new restrictions as local COVID-19 cases have spiked. On Monday, New Jersey delayed allowing indoor dining in its phased reopening, and New York said it would also consider postponing the phase.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Rental E-Scooters Will Be Legal on U.K. Roads From This Weekend</title>
            <link>https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rental-e-scooters-will-be-legal-on-u-k-roads-from-this-weekend</link>
            <description> (Bloomberg) -- Rental e-scooters will become legal on U.K. roads from July 4 after the government published the rules companies must follow to deploy the electric vehicles.&#60;p&#62; Large-scale trials can start at the weekend and last for a year, the Department for Transport said in a statement late Tuesday. It will closely monitor activity and public feedback with a view to fully legalizing scooters in future. Privately-owned models will remain illegal during this period, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The U.K. has lagged the world in allowing e-scooters to operate legally on its roads, with some restrictive laws dating back to 1835. That's not stopped them becoming a familiar sight in London and other big cities, raising the pressure on the government to establish a regulatory framework for their safe use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As we emerge from lockdown, we have a unique opportunity in transport to build back in a greener, more sustainable way that could lead to cleaner air and healthier communities, said Transport Minister Rachel Maclean.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Many of the world's biggest e-scooter rental companies now plan to roll out fleets across the U.K., including Sweden's Voi, Germany's Tier, and Bird and Lime of the U.S.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It's particularly good news for Bird and Lime, which have run into trouble this year as their unprofitable business models were strained by the pandemic that kept customers stuck at home. Both had to drastically reduce their fleets, cut hundreds of jobs and seek emergency funding, in a blow to venture capitalists who invested more than $1 billion in the companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Alan Clarke, Lime's U.K. director of policy, said Tuesday's announcement presents a real opportunity for change.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Roger Hassan, chief operating officer of Tier, said we already have more than 1,000 of our industry leading scooters in our U.K. warehouse ready to be deployed. The head of Voi in the U.K., Richard Corbett, previously ran Bird's business in the country. He said on Tuesday that Voi hopes to have its first pilot up and running in weeks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The government said last year it was contemplating a loosening of legislation on e-scooters as it had become a barrier to innovation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Coronavirus has helped to accelerate the process. In May, the government said it wanted to enable trials on U.K. roads as a way to help public transit networks adhere to social distancing guidelines as the country's lockdown is eased.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, not everyone is comfortable with the way the consultation has been unfolding. Adam Norris, a former director at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown Plc and founder of e-scooter retailer Pure Electric, said last month he was concerned the government's consultation may be unduly influenced by the firms with the biggest lobbying checkbooks, and that tends to be the American scooter rental companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Norris said at the time his company was planning to open about a dozen new high street stores this year to sell e-scooters, taking over several sites used by retailer Cycle Republic prior to its closing by parent Halfords Group Plc.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; &#194;&#169;2020 Bloomberg L.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Bloomberg&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Missing BloombergQuint's WhatsApp service?

            <title>Why BP bailed on the oil industry's one bright spot</title>
            <link>https://qz.com/1875469/why-bp-is-getting-out-of-the-plastics-business/</link>
            <description> By Tim McDonnell Climate Consciousness Plastics were supposed to be a lifeline for Big Oil.&#60;p&#62; Even before the coronavirus pandemic bottomed out demand for gasoline and jet fuel, the global transition toward climate-friendly energy and electric vehicles had hobbled their long-term outlook. Keen to diversify, Exxon, Shell Chevron , Saudi Aramco, and other oil majors have been collectively spending $40 billion a year on greenhouse gas-emitting petrochemical facilities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Petrochemicals like ethylene, benzene, and methanol are found in everything from tires and pharmaceuticals to fertilizer and laundry detergent. But their main application is in plastic&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Global plastic demand is surging , and a May outlook from McKinsey said that during the pandemic, petrochemicals have been a rare bright spot in the portfolio. But at least one of the majors will sit the plastic revolution out. On June 29, BP announced it would sell its petrochemical division for $5 billion to London-based chemical producer Ineos. What gives?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; First off, BP needed the cash. The company was hit not only by the pandemic, but by its decision this month to lower the apprised value of its oil and gas assets by $17.5 billion. The company plans to lay off 10,000 employees, and had a goal to sell $15 billion of assets by mid-2021. The chemicals sale brings it over the line ahead of schedule.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; BP was never a power player in plastics, anyway. It had already sold much of the business to Ineos back in 2005. And petrochemical plants make more money when they're built alongside oil refineries, said Steve Jenkins, vice president of petrochemicals analysis at Wood Mackenzie; BP didn't have many refineries near the Asian markets driving petrochemical demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; But the most important reason might be that BP simply isn't drinking the petrochemical kool-aid. As the oil industry faces existential threats, the biggest companies don't agree on what a profitable future looks like. Mostly those debates boil down to the timeline for peak oil: US companies tend to view it as a distant threat, while their European rivals see it as imminent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; BP's CEO Bernard Looney has been among the more fatalistic, suggesting that oil demand will never again reach pre-pandemic levels. Now it seems he just doesn't see the point in trying to get creative with oil.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The sale of its chemical business shows that they don't believe in that narrative, said Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist for Carbon Tracker, a UK think tank. We're also very confident that the expected growth in plastics that oil is hoping for is not going to happen. And if the growth won't materialize, actors in this sector will be left with stranded assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Although the pandemic has produced a bump in demand for single-use plastics, Bond said it won't trump the long-term shift toward recyclables and waste reduction. Trying to navigate BP through one epochal transition has been enough of a headache: Looney doesn't want to take the risk of jumping from one burning ship to another.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is like the electricity sector 10 years ago, when people would argue about what form of energy would knock out coal, Bond said. Now you have lots of ideas crystallizing about how to displace plastic use. BP is getting out while there's still debate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investors still seem unsure about who's right. BP's stock jumped after the sale announcement, but overall has lagged behind its plastic-savvy peers since the pandemic.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>L&#38;T achieves major milestone by flagging off final assembly of Cryostat</title>
            <link>https://www.constructionweekonline.in/business/14013-lt-achieves-major-milestone-by-flagging-off-final-assembly-of-cryostat</link>
            <description> The flagging off ceremony took place at L&#38;Ts Hazira Manufacturing Complex&#60;p&#62;The heavy engineering arm of Larsen &#38; Toubro (L&#38;T) has flagged-off the most complex and final assembly of Cryostat, the largest stainless-steel, high-vacuum pressure chamber in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The flagging off ceremony took place at L&#38;Ts Hazira Manufacturing Complex in Surat, Gujarat. The company has successfully completed fabrication of all the segments of Cryostat, including most recently the segments of Cryostat Lid.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ITER Project and ITER-India had L&#38;T their partner and the primary contractor for Cryostat fabrication.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The company has used innovative and digital manufacturing techniques to ensure uninterrupted supply of high-quality, high-precision assemblies to ITER.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This will further pave the way for the installation of Cryostat at the project site in France and eventually lead to demonstration of large-scale feasibility of fusion power.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Cryostat assembly referred as the Top Lid, weighing 650 tonne, is to be installed with other Cryostat segments for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in a reactor pit in southern France.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T has already delivered the Base section, the Lower Cylinder and the Upper Cylinder for Cryostat. The fabrication of these components has been an engineering marvel both in terms of its massive size and stringent quality standards.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The project scope for L&#38;T Heavy Engineering is divided into three aspects. Firstly, the company was to manufacture assemblies at its state-of-the-art Hazira manufacturing complex.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The second aspect involved constructing a temporary workshop at the project site in Cadarache, France, for the assembly of various sectors. And finally, it is to integrate Cryostat with Tokamak Reactor building.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With this flag-off, L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has completed the manufacturing work planned in India.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;Ts Heavy Engineering business won this contract from ITER India, a wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, for the ambitious mega scientific project, conducted in collaboration with seven elite countries including India, and with a project outlay of around USD 20 billion.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;L&#38;T Heavy Engineering has state-of-the-art, fully integrated, world-class manufacturing facilities at Hazira (Surat), Powai (Mumbai) and Vadodara.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> New Delhi, Jul 1 (PTI) The average spot power price in the real time market (RTM) in its first month of launch in June was at Rs 2.22 per unit, which is lower than Rs 2.35 per unit in day ahead market at the Indian Energy Exchange.&#60;p&#62;RTM allows consumers to purchase electricity at the exchange just one hour before delivery while in the day ahead market (DAM), power is bought for supply the next day.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IEX launched the real time market on May 31 for delivery of power from June.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IEX in a statement said RTM has accomplished volume of 515.46 MU ( million units) in June 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the statement, RTM saw a substantial sell-side liquidity at 1,810 MU - 2.4 times of the buy volumes at 742 MU -and competitive price discovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consequently, the average market clearing price was at Rs 2.22 per unit, lower than the DAM average price for June, at Rs 2.35 per unit, it added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The attractive prices enabled great savings and good financial liquidity for the utilities as well as the open access consumers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The RTM market not only facilitated unrequisitioned surplus generation capacity find buyers but also facilitated generators to purchase power to fulfil obligations created due to outages, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Setting a new precedent, two of IEX clients - Raipur Power and Raigarh Energy Generatio- became the first generators to have bought electricity to meet their commitment, it stated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The milestone of 515.46 MU volume in the first month is really an impressive accomplishment and has been possible due to robust fundamental value proposition of this new market segment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The technology enablement, capacity building and other customer centric solutions that we provided supported the market to a great start and indeed enabled IEX to reach this high point in a span of just a month," said Rohit Bajaj, Head - Business Development and Senior Vice President at IEX.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;K V N Chakradhar Babu, IAS, Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company said RTM is a boon to the cashflow constrained discoms to access quality power at the most economical prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the same time, meeting the exigent demand, block wise by the grid operator has become painless, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Satish Chavan, Director Commercial, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company said: The RTM was the necessity of the distribution companies. With the increasing purchase of infirm renewable energy to meet RPO (renewable purchase obligation) targets given by the regulator, I think this need is fulfilled by providing RTM to discoms to meet the variation in load generation balance with optimum cost."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new market segment was operationalised on the IEX platform at 10:45 pm on May 31 for delivery from 12:00 am on June 1.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;IEXs RTM provides utilities avenues to meet 24x7 power supply aspirations with 48 auction windows during the day, with delivery at 1-hour notice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The market has been launched with a vision to enable market participants meet demand variations of electricity in shorter windows, support large-scale renewable energy integration, maximise grid security and deepen the power market in the country.

            <title>Suzlon Energy completes debt restructuring as promoters satisfy capital infusion condition</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/suzlon-energy-completes-debt-restructuring-as-promoters-satisfy-capital-infusion-condition/articleshow/76726639.cms</link>
            <description> The loss making company said that its term debt has been reduced with a lower rate of interest effective July 1 and the balance debt of secured consortium lenders has been replaced by optionally convertible debenture of the company and compulsorily convertible preference shares of its subsidiary.&#60;p&#62; Mumbai: Suzlon Energy has completed its debt restructuring after satisfying the conditions put forth by the lenders that included a capital infusion of Rs 392 crores by promoters, the wind turbine maker said on Wednesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The loss making company said that its term debt has been reduced with a lower rate of interest effective July 1 and the balance debt of secured consortium lenders has been replaced by optionally convertible debenture of the company and compulsorily convertible preference shares of its subsidiary.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Chairman Tulsi Tanti said, Consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India and the company have worked together to protect the interests of all the stakeholders involved, thereby protecting the Indian wind energy sector, saving thousands of direct and indirect jobs, ensuring the survival of large number of micro, small and medium enterprises vendors and protecting around 13 gigawatts of operating wind energy assets of the nation. This initiative takes us a step forward to stay atma nirbhar' (self reliant) in manufacturing of wind turbines and its components, making India the supply chain hub for the global wind sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In March, the troubled-Suzlon Energy received approval from lenders led by State Bank of India to restructure its debt worth Rs 14,000 crore. The company and lenders were working on the resolution plan as per the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019 issued by the central bank through a circular dated June 7, 2019. The lenders had agreed to convert Rs 8,200 crore worth loans to long-term optionally convertible debentures payable in 20 years and asked promoters to infuse equity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Capital infusion of Rs 392 crores by promoters, key shareholder and various stakeholders demonstrates their commitment and confidence in Suzlon. The wind energy sector in India is at an inflection point and our debt restructuring has resulted in a stronger balance sheet enabling the company to focus on capturing the tremendous growth potential in the Indian wind energy sector, said Suzlon's group Chief Executive Officer JP Chalasani&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The term debt has been reduced substantially with interest of 9% per annum repayable over 10 years starting July 1. The balance debt of secured consortium lenders has been replaced by 0.01% optionally convertible debenture of the company and 0.0001% compulsorily convertible preference shares of its subsidiary redeemable or convertible in 20 years.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The debt restructuring will ease the pressure on the company's cash flows and give it headroom for ramping up business operations. We have reduced our fixed cost steeply and brought down the interest costs by more than 70%. This has resulted in substantial reduction in the break-even point from pre-restructuring levels ensuring a long term sustainable business case. It improves our overall competitiveness in the marketplace and now Suzlon is back to business from a position of strength, Swapnil Jain, chief financial officer said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Suzlon signed an inter-creditor agreement to resolve the debt crisis in collaboration with the company in July 2019, after the company defaulted on loan repayments and its loans were categorised as non-performing assets by lenders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This was the second instance of a major default in the 24-year life of the company, founded by Tulsi Tanti. Prior to this, in 2012, it had defaulted on repayments of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds, the biggest of its kind at the time. At the time, the company issued fresh bonds in exchange for one of the series on which it had defaulted in 2012, but it defaulted on these bonds again in 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In 2013, Suzlon's lenders restructured Rs 9,500 crore of loans as it faced a severe liquidity crunch and could not service debt. In 2015, billionaire Dilip Shanghvi came in as a white knight, buying a 23% stake. But the company's problems continued as the Indian government rolled back incentives to the wind energy sector, the market shrank and competition intensified even as debt levels remained high.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <link>https://luxurylaunches.com/gadgets/japanese-researcher-have-created-a-smart-face-mask-that-connects-to-your-phone.php</link>
            <description> We live in a world full of technology but it was a world without smart masks, until now!&#60;p&#62;A Japanese technology company Donut Robotics has taken the initiative to create the first smart face masks which connects to your phone. Of course, we couldnt have battled coronavirus with a simple mask that still does the job of protecting us perfectly well. We as a race need to bring technology into everything and more so if it does an array of extremely important, life-saving things like using a speaker to amplify a persons voice, covert a persons speech into text and then translate it into eight different languages through a smartphone app. Theres clearly no winning against Covid-19 without the above-mentioned features, except maybe investing time, money, and resources on inventing a vaccine? Anyhow till the necessary becomes available we have this white plastic c-mask fits over standard face masks and connects via&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bluetooth to a smartphone and tablet application that can transcribe speech into text messages, make calls, or amplify the mask wearers voice to help us sail through the impending difficult days. The company will also charge an additional monthly subscription fee to access translation services. The supported languages include English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian. The c-mask also comes with a built-in microphone to create recordings of important information that can then be stored on the connected smartphone.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These technologically advanced masks will be mass-produced but the first 5,000 will be for Japanese buyers and shipping will start in September with each c-mask selling for $37 a pop.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;READ: Gold-plated Airnergy Avant Garde is jazzed up with Swarovski crystals to enhance well-being&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;[Via: The Japan Times ]&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Power consumption dips to 9.74 pc to 106.48 BU in June</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power-consumption-dips-to-9-74-pc-to-106-48-bu-in-june/articleshow/76726832.cms</link>
            <description> The latest data of the Ministry of Power shows that power consumption has improved after government started giving relaxations for economic activities and intensifying heat wave in the country. The months of April, May and June this year witnessed low power consumption on account of lower commercial and industrial activities due to COVID-19-related restrictions.&#60;p&#62; &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Power consumption in June declined 9.74 per cent to 106.48 billion units (BU) as compared to 117.98 BU a year ago, mainly due to low demand amid COVID-19-related restrictions in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, the slump in power consumption has narrowed in June to 9.74 per cent from 14.86 per cent registered in May and 23.21 per cent recorded in April this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The latest data of the Ministry of Power shows that power consumption has improved after government started giving relaxations for economic activities and intensifying heat wave in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The months of April, May and June this year witnessed low power consumption on account of lower commercial and industrial activities due to COVID-19-related restrictions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; According to power ministry data, the total electricity consumption was 106.48 billion units in June this year compared to 117.98 BU in same month year ago. Power consumption in May stood at 102.18 billion units (BU).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The data showed that power consumption in April dipped 23.21 per cent to 84.55 billion units (BU).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The government had imposed lockdown from March 25 to fight the deadly coronavirus pandemic and this resulted in lower commercial and industrial demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The peak power demand met in June dipped 9.6 at 164.94GW compared to 182.45 GW in June 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The peak power demand met is defined as the highest energy supply during the day across the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In May, the peak power demand met stood at 166.42 GW, 8.82 per cent less than 182.55 GW in the year-ago period. While, in April it stood at 132.77 GW, about 25 per cent lower than 176.81 GW recorded in the corresponding month a year earlier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The peak power demand met data shows that the slump in peak power demand has stabilised below 10 per cent level in May and June compared to sharp decline of about 25 per cent in April this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Besides, lower commercial and industrial demand and the relatively cool weather during April this year played spoilsport. The temperature remained below 40 degree celsius even in the second half of the month.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, many lockdown relaxations from May 4 to 31, perked up industrial and commercial demand. Besides the rising temperatures due to intense heat wave also increased power demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With gradual easing of lockdown (from April 20) power consumption has picked up and is indicating that power consumption is inching towards normal levels (recorded last year in corresponding months), an industry expert said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The expert expressed hope that power consumption or demand will be at normal level by August.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

I appreciate the efforts taken by the Ministry for Power, Load despatch centres and market players in the field for making it successful and operational from 1st June 2020."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The new market segment was operationalised on the IEX platform at 10:45 PM on May 31, 2020 for delivery at 12:00 AM on June 01, 2020.

            <title>Buy Jindal Steel &#38; Power, target price Rs 213: ICICI Securities</title>
            <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-jindal-steel-amp-power-target-price-rs-213-icici-securities/articleshow/76727001.cms</link>
            <description> The brokerage does not see any solvency issue for JSPL given the current scenario of a quarter-long disruption.&#60;p&#62; ICICI Securities has given a buy rating to Jindal Steel &#38; Power with a target price of Rs 213. The share price moved down by -4.02 per cent from its previous close of Rs 161.50. The stock's last traded price is Rs 155.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The brokerage says Jindal Steel and Power has accepted a binding offer from Templar Investments to divest company's entire stake in Jindal Shadeed Iron and Steel. Jindal Shadeed owns the Oman steel asset. The enterprise value of the deal is over$1 bn. The timing of the deal should be linked to debt maturity of Rs 41 billionn due in Sept, '20 in the brokerage view.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Of the scheduled maturity, Rs 7.3 billion was Indian debt and the rest was overseas; Rs 28 billon was Mauritius debt. Ideally, given the ample liquidity in the global high yield bond market, refinancing shouldn't have been a problem. However, the timing of Covid-19 pandemic derailed the bond issuance. Additionally, any oversees issuance now will require guarantee of Indian assets and corresponding consent of risk-averse' Indian lenders. Hence, Temp,er will infuse more than $1 billion into JSPL for a leveraged buy out (LBO) transaction, secured by the steel assets in Oman.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Company Summary&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; COLLAPSE&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Charts&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Valuation &#38; Peer Comparison&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Community Buzz&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Investment Rationale&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The brokerage maintains a buy on Jindal Steel and Power with a target price of Rs 213/share, implying P/B of 0.62 times on FY22E P/B and implied normal cycle RoE of 7.5 per cent). The brokerage does not see any solvency issue for JSPL given the current scenario of a quarter-long disruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Risks: Sooner or later, the viability of thermal power assets will be in question. The brokerage feels that FY22E EBITDA from JPL assets (Rs 23 billion) can be at risk. One of the reasons for ascribing 0.62 times FY22E book is the possible unviability of not only foreign assets but also the earnings potential of JPL assets. Even if JPL reports half of what the brokerage is estimating i.e Rs 11-12 billionn of EBITDA, the estimated FY22E book changes to Rs 328/share from Rs 341/share currently. The target price changes to Rs 203/share from Rs 213/share currently.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Source: ICICI Securities&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Financials&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company reported consolidated sales of Rs 8810.68 crore, down -5.26 per cent from last quarter sales of Rs 9299.78 crore and down -13.27 per cent from last year's same quarter sales of Rs 10158.95 crore. The company reported net profit after tax of Rs 305.62 crore in the latest quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Promoter/FII Holdings&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Promoters held 60.48 per cent stake in the company as of March 31, 2020, while FIIs held 13.40 per cent, DIIs 12.35 per cent and public and others 13.77 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets .

            <title>Neyveli Boiler Blast: 6 Killed, Several Injured in Explosion at Tamil Nadu Power Plant</title>
            <link>https://in.news.yahoo.com/least-17-injured-boiler-explosion-060638283.html</link>
            <description> At least six people were killed and several injured in a boiler blast at the Neyveli lignite plant in Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore district on Wednesday.&#60;p&#62; Authorities said all those injured had been moved to the hospital and investigation was underway as the plant was not functional.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is the second blast at the power plant in three months, with eight people being injured in the last accident.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The incident comes close on the heels of a chemical disaster in Visakhapatnam late on Monday night in which at least two people were killed and four took ill after benzimidazole gas leaked at Sainor Life Sciences in Parawada Pharma City.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This was the second incident in the district in two months. A major gas leak occurred in LG Polymers chemical plant on May 7 causing the death of at least 12 people and numerous cattle. One similar gas leak (in a paper mill in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh) and one boiler blast (Neyveli, Tamil Nadu) followed. While these events were being investigated, on May 22, Pune saw a major fire break out in a chemical factory.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The incidents come amid the Centre's efforts to ease the restrictions induced by the coronavirus lockdown even though India has seen a consistent spike in cases.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> New Delhi, Jul 1 (IANS): Debt-laden wind power solutions provider Suzlon Energy has completed its debt restructuring process.&#60;p&#62;Under the restructuring plan, promoters and key shareholders have infused Rs 392 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In a regulatory filing, the company said that the debt restructuring completed with unanimous approval of secured lenders.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Post the announcement, shares of the company on the BSE hit the 5 per cent upper circuit. Its shares are currently at Rs 5.36, higher by 4.89 per cent from its previous close.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Term debt of the company has been reduced substantially with interest of 9 per cent per annum repayable over 10 years starting Wednesday.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Further, the balance debt of secured consortium lenders has been replaced by 0.01 per cent optionally convertible debenture (OCD) of the company and 0.0001 per cent Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) of its subsidiary redeemable or convertible in 20 years, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In March, the Suzlon Energy said that its lenders-led by the State Bank of India have approved the resolution plan as per the Reserve Bank of India's June 7, 2019 circular (RBI).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Suzlon Group CEO J.P. Chalasani said: "We are pleased to have implemented our Debt Restructuring with unanimous approval from the consortium lenders and 99.9 per cent of our FCCB holders. Capital infusion of Rs 392 crores by promoters, key shareholders and various stakeholders demonstrates their commitment and confidence in Suzlon."&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He added that the debt restructuring has resulted in a stronger balance sheet enabling the Company to focus on capturing the tremendous growth potential in the Indian wind energy sector.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Tulsi Tanti, Founder and CMD, Suzlon Group, was of the view that the restructuring has saved thousands of direct and indirect jobs, ensuring the survival of a large number of MSME vendors and protecting 13 GW of operating wind energy assets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to CFO Swapnil Jain the restructuring will ease the pressure on the group's cash flows significantly and give it headroom for ramping up business operations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"We have reduced our fixed cost steeply and brought down the interest costs by more than 70 per cent. This has resulted in substantial reduction in the break-even point from pre-restructuring levels ensuring a long term sustainable business case," Jain said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Average power price in real time market 13 paise lower at Rs 2.22 per unit in June</title>
            <link>https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/average-power-price-real-time-081858856.html</link>
            <description> New Delhi, Jul 1 (PTI) The average spot power price in the real time market (RTM) in its first month of launch in June was at Rs 2.22 per unit, which is lower than Rs 2.35 per unit in day ahead market at the Indian Energy Exchange.&#60;p&#62;RTM allows consumers to purchase electricity at the exchange just one hour before delivery while in the day ahead market (DAM), power is bought for supply the next day. IEX launched the real time market on May 31 for delivery of power from June. IEX in a statement said RTM has accomplished volume of 515.46 MU ( million units) in June 2020. According to the statement, RTM saw a substantial sell-side liquidity at 1,810 MU - 2.4 times of the buy volumes at 742 MU -and competitive price discovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consequently, the average market clearing price was at Rs 2.22 per unit, lower than the DAM average price for June, at Rs 2.35 per unit, it added. The attractive prices enabled great savings and good financial liquidity for the utilities as well as the open access consumers. The RTM market not only facilitated unrequisitioned surplus generation capacity find buyers but also facilitated generators to purchase power to fulfil obligations created due to outages, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Setting a new precedent, two of IEX clients - Raipur Power and Raigarh Energy Generatio- became the first generators to have bought electricity to meet their commitment, it stated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The milestone of 515.46 MU volume in the first month is really an impressive accomplishment and has been possible due to robust fundamental value proposition of this new market segment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;'The technology enablement, capacity building and other customer centric solutions that we provided supported the market to a great start and indeed enabled IEX to reach this high point in a span of just a month,'said Rohit Bajaj, Head - Business Development and Senior Vice President at IEX.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;K V N Chakradhar Babu, IAS, Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company said RTM is a boon to the cashflow constrained discoms to access quality power at the most economical prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At the same time, meeting the exigent demand, block wise by the grid operator has become painless, he added.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Satish Chavan, Director Commercial, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company said: The RTM was the necessity of the distribution companies. With the increasing purchase of infirm renewable energy to meet RPO (renewable purchase obligation) targets given by the regulator, I think this need is fulfilled by providing RTM to discoms to meet the variation in load generation balance with optimum cost.' The new market segment was operationalised on the IEX platform at 10:45 pm on May 31 for delivery from 12:00 am on June 1. IEXs RTM provides utilities avenues to meet 24x7 power supply aspirations with 48 auction windows during the day, with delivery at 1-hour notice. The market has been launched with a vision to enable market participants meet demand variations of electricity in shorter windows, support large-scale renewable energy integration, maximise grid security and deepen the power market in the country.

            <description> The Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) fire-fighters have been engaged in the rescue operations and the district administration's rescue teams have also reached the spot.&#60;p&#62;FP Staff&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;At least six people were killed and 17 left injured after a boiler exploded on Wednesday at Neyveli Thermal Power Station in Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore district.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to PTI, the accident was reported from the fifth unit of the thermal power station-II when workers were in the process of resuming operations in the morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) fire-fighters have been engaged in the rescue operations and the district administration's rescue teams have also reached the spot.

            <title>The cars that go furthest with the fuel light on</title>
            <link>https://www.msn.com/en-in/autos/news/the-cars-that-go-furthest-with-the-fuel-light-on/ar-BB16c2J4</link>
            <description> Have you ever played fuel light roulette? That's how far you can get after the has flashed up on the dashboard  it's a game of chance and risk.&#60;p&#62; Research from Compare the Market showed 37 percent of drivers believe they can drive for just 20 miles once the fuel light comes on. In fact, you can probably drive twice that distance  and more in the right car.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Here, we reveal the best (and worst) cars for fuel light roulette, starting with those to avoid if you don't fancy being left stranded at the roadside.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 10. Ford Fiesta  41.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; On average, you can expect to cover 40 miles in a with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; A total of 96 popular cars were compared as part of this study. Remember, driving on empty can cause mechanical problems for your vehicle, as well as leaving you stranded without fuel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 9. Nissan Juke  40.8 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Obviously, the figures provided by Compare the Market are just averages  there are many factors associated with how far you can get once the fuel light has lit up. The size of the engine, whether it's a petrol or diesel car, how fast you're driving, and the topography of the landscape are just four of the variables at play.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the outgoing Nissan Juke, you shouldn't need to panic until you've hit 40 miles in the red.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 8. Peugeot 108  39.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It's a similar story in the 108, a car that will spend much of its life in towns and cities. Which means you shouldn't find yourself too far from a fuel station.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The 108 manages 39.1 miles with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 7. Citroen C1  38.8 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Predictably, the 108's platform-sharing cousin, the Citroen C1, will cover a similar distance with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In truth, it's a good idea to refuel your car long before the gauge hits the red. That's because the fuel pump is designed to be submerged in fuel for its cooling properties and can overheat without it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 6. Jaguar XK  38.4 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Knowing how far your car can travel when the fuel light comes on could prove to be very useful if you find yourself in a remote part of the country, such as inland from the north-west coast of Scotland. You might discover that you don't have enough fuel to reach the nearest petrol station. And when you get there, it might be shut.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At least if you're in a Jaguar XK, you'll be enjoying yourself.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 5. Mitsubishi Shogun  38.2 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Of course, many modern cars will feature a sat-nav with a handy find the nearest fuel station' when the range drops below a certain level.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That said, we'd stop short of calling the dated Mitsubishi Shogun modern'. It manages 38.2 miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 4. Mini Cooper  37.5 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The average range across the brand, including the popular Mini Hatch seen above, is 37.5 miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Ford range offers the most at 55 miles, followed by Lexus with 54.9 miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 3. Fiat 500  37.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; If you're driving a Fiat 500 and the fuel light comes on, you should be good for another 37 miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; With a figure of 41.5 miles across its range, Fiat is second behind Mini on the list of manufacturers that can drive the shortest distance while on red. Porsche is third (43.6 miles), then Mitsubishi (44.5 miles) and Kia (46.1 miles).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 2. Kia Picanto  32.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Speaking of Kia, the little Picanto offers an equally minuscule 32.1 miles of range with the fuel light on. And you thought range anxiety only affected electric car drivers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Picanto has a 35-litre fuel tank.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 1. BMW M3  32.0 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is it: the car that will travel the shortest distance with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Something to consider if you've taken your BMW M3 off to a remote part of the country in search of epic driving roads.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Cars that travel furthest with the fuel light on&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; At the opposite end of the spectrum, the following cars can travel the longest distance with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; These are the cars for you if you're not a fan of rolling the dice and playing fuel light roulette.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 10. Audi A6  62.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In 2015, Andrew Frankel and Rebecca Jackson set a Guinness World Record for the most countries visited on a single tank of fuel.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; They visited 14 countries in an Audi A6, which manages 62.1 miles in the red.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 9. Mazda 6  63.0 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When the fuel light comes on in the Mazda 6, you have enough range to get you from Nottingham to Northampton.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Other locations beginning with N' are available.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 8. Range Rover Sport  63.4 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In 2017, Fergal McGrath and Paul Clifton drove a Honda Jazz 1.3 from Land's End to John O'Groats and set a Guinness World Record for the lowest fuel consumption in a petrol car. They achieved a remarkable 95.336mpg.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In other news, a can cover 63.4 miles with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 7. Audi Q5  63.8 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; When the low fuel light comes on in the Audi Q5, you've probably got enough juice to cover 64 miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As mentioned at the start of this article, however, there are a number of factors that influence how far you can actually get.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 6. Mercedes-Benz E-Class  64.0 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; All things being equal, you should be able to travel 64 miles with the fuel light on in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; And a very comfortable 64 miles it will be, too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 5. Toyota Prius  66.6 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The can travel around 2.6 miles further than the luxurious Mercedes-Benz, though.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; No wonder Uber drivers love this hybrid hatchback.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 4. BMW 5 Series  68.3 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The BMW 5 Series also beats the E-Class, it's arch-rival in the executive saloon class.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It can stretch to 68 miles with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 3. Ford Mondeo  70.0 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Amazingly, a Ford Mondeo can cover 70 miles, which is enough to get you from Exeter Airport to Bristol Airport.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Handy if you're a cabbie (who lives in Devon).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 2. Volvo V40  70.1 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Volvo V40 can travel 70.1 miles with the light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; An impressive result, but it's not the star performer on this list&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; 1. Volkswagen Passat  75.0 miles&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; That accolade belongs to the Passat, with a huge 75 miles of range available with the fuel light on.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In 2011, a Volkswagen Passat 1.6 TDI BlueMotion set a Guinness World Record for the greatest distance driven on a single tank of fuel, covering 1,581.88 miles in Croatia.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> Total asset under management in both funds stands at Rs 31,962.67 crore.&#60;p&#62; Mutual fund rating agency Morningstar has downgraded two funds managed by star fund manager Prashant Jain from gold' to silver', saying that it sees an enhanced risks to the investment strategy employed by Jain. The agency said over the 5-year and 10-year time frames, the funds have been underperforming their respective benchmarks as well as category peers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The two funds are HDFC Equity , a largecap fund, and HDFC Top 100, a multicap fund. Total asset under management in both funds stands at Rs 31,962.67 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Prashant Jain's long-term investment approach, policy of staying fully invested and backing his convictions when the strategy is out of favour have often delivered pleasing results over the long term. But there have also been periods when his valuation-conscious approach is been out of favour, said Himanshu Srivastava, research analyst at Morningstar.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Company Summary&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; EXPAND&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Infosys Ltd.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; EXPAND&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As of May, HDFC Top 100 fund that tracks Nifty100 index had exposure to 50 stocks including RIL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Infosys , HDFC Bank and Larsen &#38; Toubro, which are top holdings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In the last six months, the scheme has eroded 19.61 per cent of its value while five-year returns stand at a meagre 4 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Similarly, HDFC Equity that tracks the Nifty 500 index has exposure to 44 stocks. Top six holdings include ICICI Bank, Larsen &#38; Toubro, State Bank of India, ITC, Infosys and RIL. Six-month return for the scheme stands at -21 per cent and 5-year return 3 per cent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The portfolios are poised to benefit from the turnaround in the economic environment, but will continue to witness challenges until the trend reverses. To add to it, his investments in public sector enterprises have not yielded desired results, Srivastava said in his analysis.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; However, he added that Jain's decision to not bet on NBFC stocks has proven to be right, and the events that played out in the NBFC space as he had anticipated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets .

            <title>Indian oil, NTPC Ltd, and SDMC sign MoU on Waste to Energy plant at Okhla</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/headlines/1111866-indian-oil-ntpc-ltd-and-sdmc-sign-mou-on-waste-to-energy-plant-at-okhla</link>
            <description> An MoU was signed today on Waste to Energy plant at Okhla, Delhi, between Indian Oil, NTPC Ltd and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The&#60;p&#62;ceremony was witnessed by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &#38; Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Shri RK Singh, Minister of State (I/c) for Power and New &#38; Renewable Energy, and Shri Anil Baijal, Lt. Governor of Delhi. Secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Tarun Kapoor, Shri Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, Indian Oil, Senior officials from the Ministry of Petroleum &#38; Natural Gas, SDMC, NTPC Limited, and IndianOil were also present. Under the MoU, Indian Oil, SDMC and NTPC shall come together to develop a demonstration Waste-to-energy Plant at Okhla landfill site in Delhi, using Gasification technology. This Plant shall process 17500 tons per annum of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) produced from combustible components of Municipal Waste to generate syngas which shall, in turn, be used to generate electricity.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that management of Municipal Solid Waste&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(MSW) is a major issue in Delhi, and this Energy plant will open the path towards the solution. He congratulated IndianOil, SDMC and NTPC for coming together for this landmark project that has the potential to carve out greener and more energy-efficient future for the Atmanirbhar Bharat as envisioned by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Pradhan said that there is an existing model of providing offtake guarantee, under the SATAT scheme for compressed biogas production plants. He said that the venture would succeed, as there are guarantees from two Maharatna companies. He called for quick expansion and replication of such pilot project in other places also. The Minister said that gas generation from waste will also help in cutting imports of petroleum products and saving precious foreign exchange. Shri Pradhan asked IOCL, NTPC to join hands with the Department of Science and Technology, to develop Hydrogen Fuel technology. India has a large appetite for the energy, and development of Hydrogen technology can be done on the Commercial-scale in the country.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shri R.K.Singh said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi always talks about breaking silos and this is a good example of two ministries coming together, for a good public cause. The problem of Solid Municipal waste is rampant throughout the country, more so in Tier II and III cities. Large mounds of wastes are not only health hazards and environmental concerns, but also big eyesores. He said that the Ministry has taken a decision to support such plants, irrespective of the cost of the production of gas from them vis-&#195;&#160;-vis other means. He said that technology is used in the Delhi plant, will not only result in less emission but also provide usable residues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Shri Anil Baijal said that solid waste management is a big challenge in the national capital. On the one hand, there is a legacy of big mounds of waste accumulated over several decades, while on the other hand, there is not enough space for the current waste. The city has the capacity to process only half of its waste. The commissioning of such plants will not only provide a clean and environment-friendly way to handle solid wastes but also generate gas and manure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(With Inputs from PIB)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>All apps must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy: Niti Aayog CEO</title>
            <link>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1111927-all-apps-must-adhere-to-indias-data-integrity-privacy-niti-aayog-ceo</link>
            <description> Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Tuesday said all apps released in India must adhere to the country's data integrity, privacy, and sovereignty, a day after the government banned 59 apps.&#60;p&#62;Asserting that India has to be a data sovereign country, Kant also said apps must be transparent in terms of origin and final destination of data.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The 59 apps, most of which have Chinese links, were banned by the government citing that they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity, and security of the country. "All Apps released in India must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy, sovereignty, and transparency.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"They must be transparent in origin &#38; final destination of data. India has to be a data sovereign country. This is critical. Apps against whom action taken are lifestyle apps," Kant said in a tweet. In a series of tweets, he also said that time is ripe for the best of India technology companies to develop technology solutions for India and the world. Indians will leverage strength of diversity and build for India together, Kant said, adding that transparency, privacy, security, and ease of access will be the key principles of our product design.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;He also pointed out that the AarogyaSetu app, developed for tracking COVID-19 patients, has been a unique example of technology innovation in India, built for India, and used by millions of Indians. "Many more such examples will be created by young Indian innovators," he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The ban on the 59 apps also came against the backdrop of the current stand-off between&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;India and China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. On Monday, the Information Technology Ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India".&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;"The compilation of these data, its mining, and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures," the ministry had said in a statement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description> It is alleged that acting as middleman Bhandari induced unknown public servants to show undue favour to the consortium of M/s Samsung Engineering Corporation Ltd. South Korea in the award of contract of DFCU project at Dahej, Gujarat.&#60;p&#62; Sanjay Bhandari , the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has booked Bhandari, M/s Samsung Engineering, a South Korean company and unknown officials of ONGC/ONGO petro addition (OPAL) on charges of corruption and criminal conspiracy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It is alleged that acting as middleman Bhandari induced unknown public servants to show undue favour to the consortium of M/s Samsung Engineering Corporation Ltd. South Korea in the award of contract of DFCU project at Dahej, Gujarat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; In lieu of this, it is alleged that Bhandari's UAE based consultancy company received kickbacks from M/s SECL.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; As per available information the said deal, struck during UPA, was under the scanner of investigative agencies to probe its alleged link to the purchase of half a dozen alleged benami properties in London, allegedly for Robert Vadra , son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has already quizzed Vadra several times in connection with its ongoing probe into alleged money laundering involving purchase of a London property worth 1.9 million pounds. It had informed a local Court last year that it was looking into whether a 2008 deal, between state-run Oil &#38; Natural Gas Corporation and Samsung Engineering, was connected to the purchase of benami properties in London, allegedly for Vadra.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; Vadra has repeatedly denied all allegations against him, calling those baseless. He has also denied any business association with Sanjay Bhandari.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; People with direct knowledge of the matter indicated that with CBI registering a predicate offence in the said deal, the ED is likely to follow up on the probe and register a case.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; The CBI on Wednesday registered a case against Sanjay Bhandari, M/s. Santech International, FZC, UAE, M/s. Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd., South Korea, M/s. Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd., UK; Hong NamKoong, the then senior manager, M/s. SECL, South Korea and unknown officials of ONGC/OPaL and unknown others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; CBI has alleged that Sanjay Bhandari, Director of M/s. Santech international, UAE acted in criminal conspiracy with other accused and in furtherance of the said conspiracy entered into a consultancy agreement with M/s. SECL in violation of the contract agreement between M/s. OPaL &#38; M/s. SECL and allegedly obtained US$ 49,99,969(approx) from M/s. SECL in the overseas bank account of M/s Santech International, UAE.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This was allegedly done in order to induce unknown public servants to show alleged undue favour to the consortium of M/s SECL in the award of contract of DFCU project at Dahej, Gujarat. It is further alleged that the said agreement was relating to the consultancy services to be provided by M/s. Santech International FZC to M/s. SECL for obtaining the said contract.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ED on June 2 has charge sheeted Sanjay Bhandari on charges of money laundering paving way for his extradition from London. It might be mentioned here that Bhandari, along with unknown officials of the Indian Air Force and others, already stands booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation last June on charges of corruption in a Rs 2,985-crore deal in 2009 to procure 75 PC-7 trainer aircraft from Swiss plane maker Pilatus Aircraft.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; ET on April 29 had reported that ED has the process to confiscate properties, worth hundreds of crores, allegedly acquired by Bhandari with proceeds of crime&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; It has summoned three individuals including Bhandari's wife Sonia and 13 companies, asking them to explain their links to these properties in India and abroad.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; This is part of the proceedings to obtain the tag of fugitive economic offender for Bhandari. Bhandari is also being probed by the Income Tax Department for possessing undeclared wealth of more than Rs 500 crore.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62; (Catch all the Business News Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Canada: COVID-19 Relief For Saskatchewan Mining Companies</title>
            <link>http://www.mondaq.com/canada/mining/960646/covid-19-relief-for-saskatchewan-mining-companies</link>
            <description> On June 12, 2020, the Government of Saskatchewan announced amendments to The Mineral Tenure Registry Regulations in response to the state of emergency declared on March 18, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 18, 2020, the amendments passed third reading.&#60;p&#62;The amendments will grant relief to mining exploration companies by easing the expenditure requirements for holders of permits, claims, and leases. The amendments apply to companies engaged in the exploration of Crown minerals such as uranium, gold, copper, zinc, cobalt and rare earth elements in Saskatchewan, however, they do not apply to companies engaged in the exploration of other Crown minerals such as alkali minerals, oil and gas, coal, quarriable substances, or helium.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;What Are the Expenditure Requirements?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Pursuant to sections 37, 44, and 53 of the regulations, the holder of a Crown mineral disposition by permit, claim, or lease must satisfy their respective expenditure requirements during a given assessment work period. The particular expenditure requirements and duration of an assessment work period varies for permits, claims, and leases, and generally consists of a dollar amount per hectare per assessment work period, or a minimum dollar amount per claim or lease per assessment period. Assessment work that may contribute to satisfying expenditure requirements includes various exploration-related activities such as airborne or ground geophysical surveys, drilling and logging, geochemical surveys, geological surveys, prospecting, and trenching and stripping. If the holder of a claim or lease does not satisfy their respective expenditure requirements during a given assessment work period, they may make a non-refundable cash payment or pay a deficiency cash deposit to the Minister that is equivalent to the deficiency within 90 days after the end of the period in which the expenditure is required. Payment of a cash deficiency deposit provides the holder with the option to meet additional expenditure criteria in the subsequent assessment work period that may make them eligible for a partial or full refund of the deposit. Failure to comply with expenditure or deposit requirements may result in the issuance of a penalty pursuant to section 25(2) of the&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Crown Minerals Act.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The New Changes&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The amendments provide that:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;the Minister may waive the expenditure requirements for the work assessment period subsisting at the time of the declaration on March 18, 2020, and for the subsequent assessment work period with respect to the permit, claim or lease; any expenditures made with respect to a mineral disposition during the aforementioned relief period that is registered by the Minister may be applied toward any expenditure requirements of the regulations; and any holder that pays or has paid a deficiency cash deposit for the assessment work period immediately before March 18, 2020, may be eligible for a refund of the deposit.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Relief in Other Jurisdictions&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These amendments follow measures taken in other Canadian jurisdictions since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In Alberta, on March 23, 2020, Alberta Energy published Information Letter 2020-09, which was later replaced by Information Letter 2020-21. The Information Letter provides that Alberta Energy is prepared to offer one-year extensions for petroleum and natural gas agreements, oil sands agreements and metallic and industrial mineral permits expiring from March 20, 2020, up to and including March 31, 2021, provided that extension applications are submitted to Alberta Energy prior to agreement expiry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In British Columbia, on March 27, 2020, the Chief Gold Commissioner of British Columbia issued an order extending the time limits for various obligations of mining companies to December 31, 2021. This includes extending the period for registering a statement of exploration and development, registering payment instead of exploration and development, and registering a rental payment under the Mineral Tenure Act. The order also extended the time limits for making an application to extend the term of a coal licence and making a payment of rent for a coal lease under the Coal Act.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In Ontario, on April 17, 2020, the Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines announced relief for claim holders. Claim holders with claim anniversary dates on or before December 31, 2020, may request via email no more than 30 days before the anniversary date for their claim for the issuance of an exclusion order removing the requirement to carry out assessment work for a period of up to 12 months in respect of the claim and any claims contiguous to the eligible claims.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Conclusion&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These new amendments, like the similar programs implemented by other jurisdictions, will assist in mitigating some of the hardships experienced by mining exploration companies due to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing more time to raise capital to meet the expenditure requirements and access the mineral disposition sites to carry out exploration activities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Originally published 30 June, 2020&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

            <title>New investments in India plunge to 16-year low</title>
            <link>https://www.livemint.com/news/india/new-investments-in-india-plunge-to-16-year-low-11593592358530.html</link>
            <description> Fresh capex announcements touched historic lows in the June-ended quarter, with state government capex almost vanishing, CMIE data shows&#60;p&#62;New project announcements in India plunged to a 16-year low in the just-ended June quarter, latest data from the project-tracking database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows. As the country remained under lockdown for most of this period to combat covid-19, economic activity dropped sharply. Animal spirits of Indias entrepreneurs also seems to have dried up, the latest data suggests.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Private investments in India have been anaemic for a while, and the decline in economic activity seems to have dampened sentiments further. Government-led investment projects, which had seen their share rise over the past few years, also collapsed in the latest quarter. The drop was particularly sharp for state governments, which have been finding it hard to finance even routine expenditures.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;State governments announced new investments worth a mere Rs. 973 crores, the lowest level on record since CMIE started compiling the data in 1995. Investments by state governments have been a key driver of public sector investments but in the June-ended quarter, they accounted for only 4 percent of the value of total government projects announced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Together, public and private sector companies announced new projects worth Rs. 56,087 crores in the quarter ending June 2020, levels last recorded in June 2004. The value of new projects is half of what it was in the year-ago period, and 83 percent lower compared to the March-ended quarter. These numbers are provisional and may be revised later.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;New foreign investment plans have also dried up as the pandemic worsens the global trade and investment climate. Compared to the March-ended quarter, foreign private capex declined by 95 percent, and compared to the year-ago period, by 70 percent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The fall in capex was less sharp for the domestic private corporate sector and the central government, with capex plans declining roughly 25 percent for both, compared to the year-ago period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However, the mix of investments is skewed towards a few mega projects. Two energy sector projects, one private (Veeraballi Pumped Storage Power Project) and one by the central government (West Bengal &#38; Jharkhand Floating Solar Power Project) constitute a major share of the new capex announced in the June-ended quarter.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All sectors saw a drop in project announcements, the data shows. Compared to year-ago levels, the decline was steepest for construction sector projects, down by 93 percent, whereas electricity projects noted an uptick.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The value of stalled projects and their stalling rate rose compared to year-ago levels. But compared to the March-ended quarter, stalling rates saw a sharp decline. The stalling rate is calculated as a percentage of total projects under implementation so that the values are comparable across time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As in previous quarters, lack of funds continues to be a major reason behind stalling of projects. Unavailability of raw materials was another key factor. Covid-19 related disruptions may have contributed to the stalling rate, with many projects stalled because of other reasons. This category typically captures unanticipated disruptions and natural calamities.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With the country emerging from the lockdown amid a slight recovery in economic activity, it is likely that capex plans will recover from the current lows in the coming months. But unless the pandemic is brought under control, investor sentiment is likely to remain weak. Many firms are struggling to meet current expenses, and have little appetite for fresh investments. Others are likely to conserve cash rather than make new investments till they see signs of a sustained revival in demand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subscribe to newsletters&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;* Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.
